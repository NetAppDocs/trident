== Azure NetApp Files storage drivers
Astra Trident offers two storage drivers for Azure NetApp Files:

`azure-netapp-files`::
Creates an Azure Netapp Files volume for each PVC provisioned. This driver is best suited for high-performance workloads that require large volumes.

`azure-netapp-files-subvolume`::
Creates an Azure NetApp Files _sub volume_ for each PVC provisioned. A sub volume is a storage volume contained within a parent Azure NetApp Files volume. 
+
This driver is best suited for bursty workloads, since throughput is independent of volume size. Faster volume creation times and smaller volumes characterize this driver.
+
WARNING: Volumes created with the `azure-netapp-files-subvolume` driver can be used with RWO access mode only.

== Considerations

* The `azure-netapp-files-subvolume` driver can provision volumes as small as 20 MiB. 

* The `storagePrefix` for `azure-netapp-files-subvolume` backends can be 10 characters or less.

* The `azure-netapp-files` driver does not support volumes smaller than 100 GB. Astra Trident automatically creates 100-GB volumes if a smaller volume is requested.

* Astra Trident supports SMB volumes mounted to pods running on Windows nodes only.

* Astra Trident does not support Windows ARM architecture.
