While link:tridentctl.html[tridentctl commands and options^] is the easiest way to interact with Astra Trident's REST API, you can use the REST endpoint directly if you prefer.

This is useful for advanced installations that use Astra Trident as a standalone binary in non-Kubernetes deployments.

For better security, Astra Trident's `REST API` is restricted to localhost by default when running inside a pod. To change this behavior, you need to set Astra Trident's `-address` argument in its pod configuration.

The API works as follows:

== `GET`
* `GET <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>`: Lists all objects of that type.
* `GET <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>/<object-name>`: Gets the details of the named object.

== `POST`
`POST <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>`: Creates an object of the specified type.

* Requires a JSON configuration for the object to be created. For the specification of each object type, see link:tridentctl.html[`tridentctl` commands and options].
* If the object already exists, behavior varies: backends update the existing object, while all other object types will fail the operation.

== `DELETE`
`DELETE <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>/<object-name>`: Deletes the named resource.

NOTE: Volumes associated with backends or storage classes will continue to exist; these must be deleted separately. For more information, see link:tridentctl.html[`tridentctl` commands and options].

For examples of how these APIs are called, pass the debug (`-d`) flag. For more information, see link:tridentctl.html[`tridentctl` commands and options].
