Understand the requirements, authentication options, and export policies for configuring an ONTAP backend with ONTAP NAS drivers.

== Requirements
* For all ONTAP backends, Trident requires at least one aggregate be assigned to the SVM.
* You can run more than one driver, and create storage classes that point to one or the other. For example, you could configure a Gold class that uses the `ontap-nas` driver and a Bronze class that uses the `ontap-nas-economy` one.
* All your Kubernetes worker nodes must have the appropriate NFS tools installed. Refer to link:worker-node-prep.html[here] for more details.
* Trident supports SMB volumes mounted to pods running on Windows nodes only. Refer to <<Prepare to provision SMB volumes>> for details. 


== Authenticate the ONTAP backend

Trident offers two modes of authenticating an ONTAP backend.

* Credential-based: This mode requires sufficient permissions to the ONTAP backend. It is recommended to use an account associated with a pre-defined security login role, such as `admin` or `vsadmin` to ensure maximum compatibility with ONTAP versions.
* Certificate-based: This mode requires a certificate installed on the backend for Trident to communicate with an ONTAP cluster. Here, the backend definition must contain Base64-encoded values of the client certificate, key, and the trusted CA certificate if used (recommended).

You can update existing backends to move between credential-based and certificate-based methods. However, only one authentication method is supported at a time. To switch to a different authentication method, you must remove the existing method from the backend configuration.

WARNING: If you attempt to provide *both credentials and certificates*, backend creation will fail with an error that more than one authentication method was provided in the configuration file. 

=== Enable credential-based authentication

Trident requires the credentials to an SVM-scoped/cluster-scoped admin to communicate with the ONTAP backend. It is recommended to make use of standard, pre-defined roles such as `admin` or `vsadmin`. This ensures forward compatibility with future ONTAP releases that might expose feature APIs to be used by future Trident releases. A custom security login role can be created and used with Trident, but is not recommended.

A sample backend definition will look like this:

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.YAML
--
[source,yaml]
----
---
version: 1
backendName: ExampleBackend
storageDriverName: ontap-nas
managementLIF: 10.0.0.1
dataLIF: 10.0.0.2
svm: svm_nfs
username: vsadmin
password: password
----
--

{
  "version": 1,
  "backendName": "ExampleBackend",
  "storageDriverName": "ontap-nas",

  "dataLIF": "10.0.0.2",
  "svm": "svm_nfs",
  "username": "vsadmin",
  "password": "password"
}
----
--
====

// end tabbed area


Keep in mind that the backend definition is the only place the credentials are stored in plain text. After the backend is created, usernames/passwords are encoded with Base64 and stored as Kubernetes secrets. The creation/updation of a backend is the only step that requires knowledge of the credentials. As such, it is an admin-only operation, to be performed by the Kubernetes/storage administrator.

=== Enable certificate-based Authentication

New and existing backends can use a certificate and communicate with the ONTAP backend. Three parameters are required in the backend definition.

* clientCertificate: Base64-encoded value of client certificate.
* clientPrivateKey: Base64-encoded value of associated private key.
* trustedCACertificate: Base64-encoded value of trusted CA certificate. If using a trusted CA, this parameter must be provided. This can be ignored if no trusted CA is used.

A typical workflow involves the following steps.

.Steps

. Generate a client certificate and key. When generating, set Common Name (CN) to the ONTAP user to authenticate as.
+
----
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout k8senv.key -out k8senv.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=NC/L=RTP/O=NetApp/CN=vsadmin"
----
. Add trusted CA certificate to the ONTAP cluster. This might be already handled by the storage administrator. Ignore if no trusted CA is used.
+
----
security certificate install -type server -cert-name <trusted-ca-cert-name> -vserver <vserver-name>
ssl modify -vserver <vserver-name> -server-enabled true -client-enabled true -common-name <common-name> -serial <SN-from-trusted-CA-cert> -ca <cert-authority>
----
. Install the client certificate and key (from step 1) on the ONTAP cluster.
+
----
security certificate install -type client-ca -cert-name <certificate-name> -vserver <vserver-name>
security ssl modify -vserver <vserver-name> -client-enabled true
----
. Confirm the ONTAP security login role supports `cert` authentication method.
+
----
security login create -user-or-group-name vsadmin -application ontapi -authentication-method cert -vserver <vserver-name> 
security login create -user-or-group-name vsadmin -application http -authentication-method cert -vserver <vserver-name>
----
. Test authentication using certificate generated. Replace <ONTAP Management LIF> and <vserver name> with Management LIF IP and SVM name. You must ensure the LIF has its service policy set to `default-data-management`.
+
----
curl -X POST -Lk https://<ONTAP-Management-LIF>/servlets/netapp.servlets.admin.XMLrequest_filer --key k8senv.key --cert ~/k8senv.pem -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><netapp xmlns="http://www.netapp.com/filer/admin" version="1.21" vfiler="<vserver-name>"><vserver-get></vserver-get></netapp>'
----
. Encode certificate, key and trusted CA certificate with Base64.
+
----
base64 -w 0 k8senv.pem >> cert_base64
base64 -w 0 k8senv.key >> key_base64
base64 -w 0 trustedca.pem >> trustedca_base64
----
. Create backend using the values obtained from the previous step.

=== Update authentication methods or rotate credentials

You can update an existing backend to use a different authentication method or to rotate their credentials. This works both ways: backends that make use of username/password can be updated to use certificates; backends that utilize certificates can be updated to username/password based. To do this, you must remove the existing authentication method and add the new authentication method. Then use the updated backend.json file containing the required parameters to execute `tridentctl update backend`.

#Update backend with tridentctl

+------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
----

NOTE: When rotating passwords, the storage administrator must first update the password for the user on ONTAP. This is followed by a backend update. When rotating certificates, multiple certificates can be added to the user. The backend is then updated to use the new certificate, following which the old certificate can be deleted from the ONTAP cluster.

Updating a backend does not disrupt access to volumes that have already been created, nor impact volume connections made after. A successful backend update indicates that Trident can communicate with the ONTAP backend and handle future volume operations.

=== Create custom ONTAP role for Trident

You can create an ONTAP cluster role with minimum privileges so that you do not have to use the ONTAP admin role to perform operations in Trident. When you include the username in a Trident backend configuration, Trident uses the ONTAP cluster role you created to perform the operations.

Refer to link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/master/contrib/ontap/trident_role[Trident custom-role generator] for more information about creating Trident custom roles.

== Manage NFS export policies

Trident uses NFS export policies to control access to the volumes that it provisions.

Trident provides two options when working with export policies:

* Trident can dynamically manage the export policy itself; in this mode of operation, the storage administrator specifies a list of CIDR blocks that represent admissible IP addresses. Trident adds applicable node IPs that fall in these ranges to the export policy automatically at publish time. Alternatively, when no CIDRs are specified, all global-scoped unicast IPs found on the node that the volume being published to will be added to the export policy.
* Storage administrators can create an export policy and add rules manually. Trident uses the default export policy unless a different export policy name is specified in the configuration.

=== Dynamically manage export policies

Trident provides the ability to dynamically manage export policies for ONTAP backends. This provides the storage administrator the ability to specify a permissible address space for worker node IPs, rather than defining explicit rules manually. It greatly simplifies export policy management; modifications to the export policy no longer require manual intervention on the storage cluster. Moreover, this helps restrict access to the storage cluster only to worker nodes that are mounting volumes and have IPs in the range specified, supporting a fine-grained and automated management.

NOTE: Do not use Network Address Translation (NAT) when using dynamic export policies. With NAT, the storage controller sees the frontend NAT address and not the actual IP host address, so access will be denied when no match is found in the export rules.

==== Example

There are two configuration options that must be used. Here's an example backend definition:
[source,yaml]
----
---
version: 1
storageDriverName: ontap-nas-economy
backendName: ontap_nas_auto_export
managementLIF: 192.168.0.135
svm: svm1
username: vsadmin
password: password
autoExportCIDRs:
  - 192.168.0.0/24
autoExportPolicy: true

----

NOTE: When using this feature, you must ensure that the root junction in your SVM has a previously created export policy with an export rule that permits the node CIDR block (such as the default export policy). Always follow NetApp recommended best practice to dedicate an SVM for Trident.

Here is an explanation of how this feature works using the example above:

* `autoExportPolicy` is set to `true`. This indicates that Trident creates an export policy for each volume provisioned with this backend for the `svm1` SVM and handle the addition and deletion of rules using `autoexportCIDRs` address blocks. Until a volume is attached to a node, the volume uses an empty export policy with no rules to prevent unwanted access to that volume. When a volume is published to a node Trident creates an export policy with the same name as the underlying qtree containing the node IP within the specified CIDR block. These IPs will also be added to the export policy used by the parent FlexVol volume
** For example:
*** backend UUID 403b5326-8482-40db-96d0-d83fb3f4daec
*** `autoExportPolicy` set to `true`
*** storage prefix `trident`
*** PVC UUID a79bcf5f-7b6d-4a40-9876-e2551f159c1c
*** qtree named trident_pvc_a79bcf5f_7b6d_4a40_9876_e2551f159c1c creates an export policy for the FlexVol named `trident-403b5326-8482-40db96d0-d83fb3f4daec`, an export policy for the qtree named 
`trident_pvc_a79bcf5f_7b6d_4a40_9876_e2551f159c1c`, and an empty export policy named `trident_empty` on the SVM. The rules for the FlexVol export policy will be a superset of any rules contained in the qtree export policies. The empty export policy will be reused by any volumes that are not attached.

* `autoExportCIDRs` contains a list of address blocks. This field is optional and it defaults to ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]. If not defined, Trident adds all globally-scoped unicast addresses found on the worker nodes with publications.

In this example, the `192.168.0.0/24` address space is provided. This indicates that Kubernetes node IPs that fall within this address range with publications will be added to the export policy that Trident creates. When Trident registers a node it runs on, it retrieves the IP addresses of the node and checks them against the address blocks provided in `autoExportCIDRs`. At publish time, after filtering the IPs, Trident creates the export policy rules for the client IPs for the node it is publishing to.

You can update `autoExportPolicy` and `autoExportCIDRs` for backends after you create them. You can append new CIDRs for a backend that is automatically managed or delete existing CIDRs. Exercise care when deleting CIDRs to ensure that existing connections are not dropped. You can also choose to disable `autoExportPolicy` for a backend and fall back to a manually created export policy. This will require setting the `exportPolicy` parameter in your backend config.

After Trident creates or updates a backend, you can check the backend using `tridentctl` or the corresponding `tridentbackend` CRD:
----
./tridentctl get backends ontap_nas_auto_export -n trident -o yaml
items:
- backendUUID: 403b5326-8482-40db-96d0-d83fb3f4daec
  config:
    aggregate: ""
    autoExportCIDRs:
    - 192.168.0.0/24
    autoExportPolicy: true
    backendName: ontap_nas_auto_export
    chapInitiatorSecret: ""
    chapTargetInitiatorSecret: ""
    chapTargetUsername: ""
    chapUsername: ""
    dataLIF: 192.168.0.135
    debug: false
    debugTraceFlags: null
    defaults:
      encryption: "false"
      exportPolicy: <automatic>
      fileSystemType: ext4
----

When a node is removed, Trident checks all export policies to remove the access rules corresponding to the node. By removing this node IP from the export policies of managed backends, Trident prevents rogue mounts, unless this IP is reused by a new node in the cluster.

For previously existing backends, updating the backend with `tridentctl update backend` ensures that Trident manages the export policies automatically. This creates two new export policies named after the backend's UUID and qtree name when they are needed. Volumes that are present on the backend will use the newly created export policies after they are unmounted and mounted again.

NOTE: Deleting a backend with auto-managed export policies will delete the dynamically created export policy. If the backend is re-created, it is treated as a new backend and will result in the creation of a new export policy.

If the IP address of a live node is updated, you must restart the Trident pod on the node. Trident will then update the export policy for backends it manages to reflect this IP change.

== Prepare to provision SMB volumes
With a little additional preparation, you can provision SMB volumes using `ontap-nas` drivers. 

WARNING: You must configure both NFS and SMB/CIFS protocols on the SVM to create an `ontap-nas-economy` SMB volume for ONTAP on-premises clusters. Failure to configure either of these protocols will cause SMB volume creation to fail.

NOTE: `autoExportPolicy` is not supported for SMB volumes.

.Before you begin
Before you can provision SMB volumes, you must have the following. 

* A Kubernetes cluster with a Linux controller node and at least one Windows worker node running Windows Server 2022. Trident supports SMB volumes mounted to pods running on Windows nodes only.

* At least one Trident secret containing your Active Directory credentials. To generate secret `smbcreds`:
+
----
kubectl create secret generic smbcreds --from-literal username=user --from-literal password='password'
----

* A CSI proxy configured as a Windows service. To configure a `csi-proxy`, refer to link:https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy[GitHub: CSI Proxy^] or link:https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/csi-proxy-windows.md[GitHub: CSI Proxy for Windows^] for Kubernetes nodes running on Windows.

.Steps

. For on-premises ONTAP, you can optionally create an SMB share or Trident can create one for you. 
+
NOTE: SMB shares are required for Amazon FSx for ONTAP. 
+
You can create the SMB admin shares in one of two ways either using the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/what-is-microsoft-management-console[Microsoft Management Console^] Shared Folders snap-in or using the ONTAP CLI. To create the SMB shares using the ONTAP CLI:
+
.. If necessary, create the directory path structure for the share.
+
The `vserver cifs share create` command checks the path specified in the -path option during share creation. If the specified path does not exist, the command fails.

.. Create an SMB share associated with the specified SVM:
+
----
vserver cifs share create -vserver vserver_name -share-name share_name -path path [-share-properties share_properties,...] [other_attributes] [-comment text]
----

.. Verify that the share was created:
+
----
vserver cifs share show -share-name share_name
----
+
NOTE: Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smb-config/create-share-task.html[Create an SMB share^] for full details.

. When creating the backend, you must configure the following to specify SMB volumes. For all FSx for ONTAP backend configuration options, refer to link:trident-fsx-examples.html[FSx for ONTAP configuration options and examples].
