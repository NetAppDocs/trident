You can easily upgrade an existing Astra Trident installation using `tridentctl`.

== Upgrade Astra Trident using `tridentctl`
Uninstalling and reinstalling Astra Trident acts as an upgrade. When you uninstall Trident, the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and Persistent Volume (PV) used by the Astra Trident deployment are not deleted. PVs that have already been provisioned will remain available while Astra Trident is offline, and Astra Trident will provision volumes for any PVCs that are created in the interim once it is back online.

.Before you begin
Review link:upgrade-trident.html#select-an-upgrade-method[Select an upgrade method] before upgrading using `tridentctl`. 

.Steps

. Run the uninstall command in `tridentctl` to remove all of the resources associated with Astra Trident except for the CRDs and related objects.
+
----
./tridentctl uninstall -n <namespace>
----
. Reinstall Astra Trident. Refer to link:..trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-tridentctl.html[Install Astra Trident using tridentctl]. 

IMPORTANT: Do not interrupt the upgrade process. Ensure the installer runs to completion.

== Upgrade volumes using `tridentctl`
After upgrade, you can make use of the rich set of features that are available in newer Trident releases (such as, On-Demand Volume Snapshots), you can upgrade the volumes using the `tridentctl upgrade` command.

If there are legacy volumes, you should upgrade them from a NFS or iSCSI type to the CSI type to use the complete set of new features in Astra Trident. A legacy PV that has been provisioned by Trident supports the traditional set of features.

.Before you begin
Consider the following before deciding to upgrade volumes to the CSI type:

* You might not need to upgrade all the volumes. Previously created volumes will continue to be accessible and function normally.
* A PV can be mounted as part of a deployment/StatefulSet when upgrading. It is not required to bring down the deployment/StatefulSet.
* You *cannot* attach a PV to a standalone pod when upgrading. You should shut down the pod before upgrading the volume.
* You can upgrade only a volume that is bound to a PVC. Volumes that are not bound to PVCs should be removed and imported before upgrading.

.Steps

. Run `kubectl get pv` to list the PVs.

There are currently four PVs that have been created by Trident 20.07, using the `netapp.io/trident` provisioner.
. Run `kubectl describe pv` to get the details of the PV.

The PV was created by using the `netapp.io/trident` provisioner and is of the type NFS. To support all the new features provided by Astra Trident, this PV should be upgraded to the CSI type.
. Run the `tridentctl upgrade volume <name-of-trident-volume>` command to upgrade a legacy Astra Trident volume to the CSI spec.
