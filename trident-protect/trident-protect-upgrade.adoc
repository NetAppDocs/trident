You can upgrade Trident protect to the latest version to take advantage of new features or bug fixes.

[NOTE]
====
When you upgrade from version 24.10, snapshots running during the upgrade might fail.  This failure does not prevent future snapshots, whether manual or scheduled, from being created. I a snapshot fails during the upgrade, you can manually create a new snapshot to ensure your application is protected.
To avoid potential failures, you can disable all snapshot schedules before the upgrade and re-enable them afterward. However, this results in missing any scheduled snapshots during the upgrade period.
