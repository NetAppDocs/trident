Learn about configuring an ONTAP backend with ONTAP and Cloud Volumes ONTAP NAS drivers.

== Important information about ONTAP NAS drivers
Astra Control provides seamless protection, disaster recovery, and mobility (moving volumes between Kubernetes clusters) for volumes created with the `ontap-nas`, `ontap-nas-flexgroup`, and `ontap-san` drivers. See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/replicate_snapmirror.html#replication-prerequisites[Astra Control replication prerequisites^] for details. 

* You must use `ontap-nas` for production workloads that require data protection, disaster recovery, and mobility. 
* Use `ontap-san-economy` when anticipated volume usage is expected to be much higher than what ONTAP supports. 
* Use `ontap-nas-economy` only where anticipated volume usage is expected to be much higher than what ONTAP supports, and the `ontap-san-economy` driver cannot be used. 
* Do not use use `ontap-nas-economy` if you anticipate the need for data protection, disaster recovery, or mobility.

== User permissions
Astra Trident expects to be run as either an ONTAP or SVM administrator, typically using the `admin` cluster user or a `vsadmin` SVM user, or a user with a different name that has the same role. 

For Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP deployments, Astra Trident expects to be run as either an ONTAP or SVM administrator, using the cluster `fsxadmin` user or a `vsadmin` SVM user, or a user with a different name that has the same role. The `fsxadmin` user is a limited replacement for the cluster admin user.

NOTE: If you use the `limitAggregateUsage` parameter, cluster admin permissions are required. When using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with Astra Trident, the `limitAggregateUsage` parameter will not work with the `vsadmin` and `fsxadmin` user accounts. The configuration operation will fail if you specify this parameter.

While it is possible to create a more restrictive role within ONTAP that a Trident driver can use, we don't recommend it. Most new releases of Trident will call additional APIs that would have to be accounted for, making upgrades difficult and error-prone.
