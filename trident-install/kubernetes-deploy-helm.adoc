You can deploy the Trident operator and install Trident using Helm. This process applies to installations where the container images required by Trident are not stored in a private registry. If you do have a private image registry, use the link:kubernetes-deploy-helm-mirror.html[process for offline deployment].

== Critical information about Trident 24.10
*You must read the following critical information about Trident.*

// Start snippet: collapsible block (open on page load)
.*Critical information about Trident*
[%collapsible%open]
====
=======
* Kubernetes 1.31 is now supported in Trident. Upgrade Trident prior to upgrading Kubernetes.
* Trident strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of `find_multipaths: no` in multipath.conf file. 
+
Use of non-multipathing configuration or use of `find_multipaths: yes` or `find_multipaths: smart` value in multipath.conf file will result in mount failures. Trident has recommended the use of `find_multipaths: no` since the 21.07 release.

== Deploy the Trident operator and install Trident using Helm
Using the Trident link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/netapp-trident/trident-operator[Helm Chart^] you can deploy the Trident operator and install Trident in one step. 

Review link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[the installation overview] to ensure you've met installation prerequisites and selected the correct installation option for your environment.

.Before you begin

In addition to the link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html#before-you-deploy[deployment prerequisites] you need link:https://v3.helm.sh/[Helm version 3^].

.Steps

. Add the Trident Helm repository:
+
----
helm repo add netapp-trident https://netapp.github.io/trident-helm-chart
----

. Use `helm install` and specify a name for your deployment as in the following example where `100.2404.0` is the version of Trident you are installing. 
+
----
helm install <name> netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 100.2410.0 --create-namespace --namespace <trident-namespace>
----
+
NOTE: If you already created a namespace for Trident, the `--create-namespace` parameter will not create an additional namespace.

You can use `helm list` to review installation details such as name, namespace, chart, status, app version, and revision number.


== Pass configuration data during install

There are two ways to pass configuration data during the install:

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
|Option
|Description

|`--values` (or `-f`)
a|Specify a YAML file with overrides. This can be specified multiple times and the rightmost file will take precedence.

|`--set`
a|Specify overrides on the command line.

|===

For example, to change the default value of `debug`, run the following command where `100.2410.0` is the version of Trident you are installing:

----
helm install <name> netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 100.2410.0  --create-namespace --namespace trident --set tridentDebug=true
----

== Configuration options
This table and the `values.yaml` file, which is part of the Helm chart, provide the list of keys and their default values.

=== Understanding controller pods and node pods
Trident runs as a single controller pod, plus a node pod on each worker node in the cluster. The node pod must be running on any host where you want to potentially mount a Trident volume. 

Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[node selectors^] and link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[tolerations and taints^] are used to constrain a pod to run on a specific or preferred node. Using the`ControllerPlugin` and `NodePlugin`, you can specify constraints and overrides.

* The controller plugin handles volume provisioning and management, such as snapshots and resizing. 
* The node plugin handles attaching the storage to the node.
