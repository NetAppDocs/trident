Learn about the steps involved in downgrading to an earlier version of Astra Trident.

You might consider downgrading for various reasons, such as the following:

* Contingency planning
* Immediate fix for bugs observed as a result of an upgrade
* Dependency issues, unsuccessful and incomplete upgrades

== When to downgrade

You should consider a downgrade when moving to a Astra Trident release that uses CRDs. Because Astra Trident now uses CRDs for maintaining state, all storage entities created (backends, storage classes, PV, and volume snapshots) have associated CRD objects instead of data written into the `trident` PV (used by the earlier installed version of Astra Trident). Newly created PVs, backends, and storage classes are all maintained as CRD objects. If you need to downgrade, this should only be attempted for a version of Astra Trident that runs using CRDs (19.07 and later). This is to ensure that all the operations performed on the current Astra Trident release are visible after the downgrade occurs.

== When not to downgrade

You should not downgrade to a release of Trident that uses `etcd` to maintain state (19.04 and earlier). All operations performed with the current Astra Trident release are not reflected after the downgrade. Newly created PVs are not usable when moving back to an earlier version. Changes made to objects such as backends, PVs, storage classes, and volume snapshots (created/updated/deleted) are not visible to Astra Trident when moving back to an earlier version. Going back to an earlier version does not disrupt access for PVs that were already created by using the older release, unless they have been upgraded.

== Downgrade process when Astra Trident is installed by using the operator

For installations done using the Trident Operator, the downgrade process is different and does not require the use of `tridentctl`.

For installations done using the Trident operator, Astra Trident can be downgraded to either of the following:

* A version that is installed using the namespace-scoped operator (20.07 - 20.10).
* A version that is installed using the cluster-scoped operator (21.01 and later).

=== Downgrade to cluster-scoped operator

To downgrade Astra Trident to a release that uses the cluster-scoped operator, follow the steps mentioned below.

.Steps
. link:uninstall-trident.html[Uninstall Astra Trident^]. **Do not wipeout the CRDs unless you want to completely remove an existing installation.**
. Delete the cluster-scoped operator. To do this, you will need the manifest used to deploy the operator. You can obtain it from the https://github.com/NetApp/trident/blob/stable/v21.07/deploy/bundle.yaml[Trident GitHub repo^]. Make sure you switch to the required branch.
. Continue downgrading by installing the desired version of Astra Trident. Follow the documentation for the desired release.

=== Downgrade to namespace-scoped operator

This section summarizes the steps involved in downgrading to an Astra Trident release that falls in the range 20.07 through 20.10, which will be installed using the namespace-scoped operator.

.Steps
. link:uninstall-trident.html[Uninstall Astra Trident^]. **Do not wipeout the CRDs unless you want to completely remove an existing installation.**
Make sure the `tridentorchestrator` is deleted.

----
Astra Trident has been uninstalled.
. Continue downgrading by installing the desired version. Follow the documentation for the desired release.

=== Downgrade by using Helm

To downgrade, use the `helm rollback` command. See the following example:
----
$ helm rollback trident [revision #]
----

== Downgrade process when Astra Trident is installed by using `tridentctl`

If you installed Astra Trident by using `tridentctl`, the downgrade process involves the following steps. This sequence walks you through the downgrade process to move from Astra Trident 21.07 to 20.07.

NOTE: Before beginning the downgrade, you should take a snapshot of your Kubernetes cluster’s `etcd`. This enables you to back up the current state of Astra Trident’s CRDs.

.Steps
. Make sure that Trident is installed by using `tridentctl`. If you are unsure about how Astra Trident is installed, run this simple test:
.. List the pods present in the Trident namespace.
.. Identify the version of Astra Trident running in your cluster. You can either use `tridentctl` or take a look at the image used in the Trident pods.
.. If you *do not see* a `tridentOrchestrator`, (or) a `tridentprovisioner`, (or) a pod named `trident-operator-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx`, Astra Trident *is installed* with `tridentctl`.
. Uninstall Astra Trident with the existing `tridentctl` binary.  In this case, you will uninstall with the 21.07 binary.

. After this is complete, obtain the Trident binary for the desired version (in this example, 20.07), and use it to install Astra Trident. You can generate custom YAMLs for a link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-customize-deploy-tridentctl.html[customized installation^] if needed.
