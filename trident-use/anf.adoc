You can configure Azure NetApp Files (ANF) as the backend for Astra Trident. You can attach NFS and SMB volumes using an ANF backend.

== Considerations

* The Azure NetApp Files service does not support volumes smaller than 100 GB. Astra Trident automatically creates 100-GB volumes if a smaller volume is requested.

* Astra Trident supports SMB volumes mounted to pods running on Windows nodes only.
