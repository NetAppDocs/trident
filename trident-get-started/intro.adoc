Trident is a fully-supported open source project maintained by NetApp. It has been designed to help you meet your containerized application's persistence demands using industry-standard interfaces, such as the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

== What is Trident?
Netapp Trident enables consumption and management of storage resources across all popular NetApp storage platforms, in the public cloud or on premises, including on-premises ONTAP clusters (AFF, FAS, and ASA), ONTAP Select, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Element software (NetApp HCI, SolidFire), Azure NetApp Files, Amazon FSx for
NetApp ONTAP, and Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud. 

Trident is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) compliant dynamic storage orchestrator that natively integrates with link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes^]. Trident runs as a single Controller Pod plus a Node Pod on each worker node in the cluster. Refer to link:../trident-get-started/architecture.html[Trident architecture] for details. 

Trident also provides direct integration with the Docker ecosystem for NetApp storage platforms. The NetApp Docker Volume Plugin (nDVP) supports the provisioning and management of storage resources from the storage platform to Docker hosts. Refer to link:../trident-docker/deploy-docker.html[Deploy Trident for Docker] for details.

NOTE: If this is your first time using Kubernetes, you should familiarize yourself with the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/[Kubernetes concepts and tools^].

== Kubernetes integration with NetApp products
The NetApp portfolio of storage products integrates with many aspects of a Kubernetes cluster, providing advanced data management capabilities, which enhance the functionality, capability, performance, and availability of the Kubernetes deployment.
