Learn how to create and use an Element backend with your Astra Trident installation.

== Element driver details
Astra Trident provides the `solidfire-san` storage driver to communicate with the cluster. Supported access modes are: _ReadWriteOnce_ (RWO), _ReadOnlyMany_ (ROX), _ReadWriteMany_ (RWX), _ReadWriteOncePod_ (RWOP).

The `solidfire-san` storage driver supports _file_ and _block_ volume modes. For the `Filesystem` volumeMode, Astra Trident creates a volume and creates a filesystem. The filesystem type is specified by the StorageClass.

== Before you begin

You'll need the following before creating an Element backend. 

* A supported storage system that runs Element software.
* Credentials to a NetApp HCI/SolidFire cluster admin or tenant user that can manage volumes.
* All of your Kubernetes worker nodes should have the appropriate iSCSI tools installed. Refer to link:../trident-use/worker-node-prep.html[worker node preparation information].

== Backend configuration options

See the following table for the backend configuration options:

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`version` | |Always 1

|`storageDriverName` | Name of the storage driver |Always “solidfire-san”

|`backendName`  |Custom name or the storage backend |“solidfire_” + storage (iSCSI) IP address

|`Endpoint` |MVIP for the SolidFire cluster with tenant credentials |

|`SVIP` |Storage (iSCSI) IP address and port |

|`labels` |Set of arbitrary JSON-formatted labels to apply on volumes. |“”

|`TenantName` |Tenant name to use (created if not found) |

|`InitiatorIFace` |Restrict iSCSI traffic to a specific host interface |“default”

|`UseCHAP` |Use CHAP to authenticate iSCSI. Astra Trident uses CHAP. |true

|`AccessGroups`  |List of Access Group IDs to use |Finds the ID of an access group named “trident”

| `Types` |QoS specifications |

|`limitVolumeSize` |Fail provisioning if requested volume size is above this value |“” (not enforced by default)

| `debugTraceFlags` |Debug flags to use when troubleshooting. Example, {“api”:false, “method”:true} |null

|===

WARNING: Do not use `debugTraceFlags` unless you are troubleshooting and require a detailed log dump.

== Example 1: Backend configuration for `solidfire-san` driver with three volume types

This example shows a backend file using CHAP authentication and modeling three volume types with specific QoS guarantees. Most likely you would then define storage classes to consume each of these using the `IOPS` storage class parameter.

== Example 2: Backend and storage class configuration for `solidfire-san` driver with virtual pools

This example shows the backend definition file configured with virtual pools along with StorageClasses that refer back to them.

Astra Trident copies labels present on a storage pool to the backend storage LUN at provisioning. For convenience, storage administrators can define labels per virtual pool and group volumes by label. 

In the sample backend definition file shown below, specific defaults are set for all storage pools, which set the `type` at Silver. The virtual pools are defined in the `storage` section. In this example, some of the storage pools set their own type, and some pools override the default values set above.

The following StorageClass definitions refer to the above virtual pools. Using the `parameters.selector` field, each StorageClass calls out which virtual pool(s) can be used to host a volume. The volume will have the aspects defined in the chosen virtual pool.

The first StorageClass (`solidfire-gold-four`) will map to the first virtual pool. This is the only pool offering gold performance with a `Volume Type QoS` of Gold. The last StorageClass (`solidfire-silver`) calls out any storage pool which offers a silver performance. Astra Trident will decide which virtual pool is selected and will ensure the storage requirement is met.
