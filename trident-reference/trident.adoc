Trident exposes several command-line options. You can modify them in your deployment.

== Logging

* `-debug`: Enables debugging output.
* `-loglevel <level>`: Sets the logging level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal). Defaults to info.

== Kubernetes

* `-k8s_pod`: This option or ``-k8s_api_server` must be
set to enable Kubernetes support. Setting this causes Trident to use
its containing pod's Kubernetes service account credentials to contact
the API server. This only works when Trident runs as a pod in a
Kubernetes cluster with service accounts enabled.
* `-k8s_api_server <insecure-address:insecure-port>`: This option or ``-k8s_pod` must be used to enable Kubernetes support. When specified, Trident connects to the Kubernetes API server using the
provided insecure address and port. This allows Trident to be deployed outside of a pod; however, it only supports insecure connections to the API server. To connect securely, deploy Trident in a pod with the
``-k8s_pod` option.
* `-k8s_config_path <file>`: Path to a KubeConfig file.

== Docker

* `-volume_driver <name>`: Driver name used when registering the Docker plugin. Defaults to 'netapp'.
* `-driver_port <port-number>`: Listen on this port rather than a UNIX domain socket.
* `-config <file>`: Path to a backend configuration file.

== REST

* `-address <ip-or-host>`: Specifies the address on which Trident's REST server should listen. Defaults to localhost. When listening on localhost and running inside a Kubernetes pod, the REST interface isn't directly accessible from outside the pod. Use -address "" to make the REST interface accessible from the pod IP address.
* `-port <port-number>`: Specifies the port on which Trident's REST server should listen. Defaults to 8000.
* `-rest`: Enables the REST interface. Defaults to true.

== Ports

Trident communicates over the following ports:

[cols="2,4" options="header"]
|===
|Port |Purpose
|8443 |Backchannel HTTPS
|8001 |Prometheus metrics endpoint
|8000 |Trident REST server
|17546 |Liveness/readiness probe port used by Trident daemonset pods
|===

[NOTE]
The liveness/readiness probe port can be changed during installation
time using the `--probe-port` flag. It is important to make sure this port
isn't being used by another process on the worker nodes.
