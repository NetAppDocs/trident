Depending on how Astra Trident is installed, there are multiple options to uninstall it.

== Uninstall by using Helm

If you installed Astra Trident by using Helm, you can uninstall it by using `helm uninstall`.

----
#List the Helm release corresponding to the Astra Trident install.
$ helm ls -n trident
NAME          NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION
trident       trident         1               2021-04-20 00:26:42.417764794 +0000 UTC deployed        trident-operator-21.07.1        21.07.1

#Uninstall Helm release to remove Trident
$ helm uninstall trident -n trident
release "trident" uninstalled

== Uninstall by using the Trident operator

If you installed Astra Trident by using the operator, you can uninstall it by doing one of the following:

* **Edit `TridentOrchestrator` to set the uninstall flag:** You can edit `TridentOrchestrator` and set `spec.uninstall=true`. Edit the `TridentOrchestrator` CR and set the `uninstall` flag as shown below:
+
----
$  kubectl patch torc <trident-orchestrator-name> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"uninstall":true}}'
----
When the `uninstall` flag is set to `true`, the Trident operator uninstalls Trident, but does not remove the TridentOrchestrator itself. You should clean up the TridentOrchestrator and create a new one if you want to
install Trident again.
* **Delete `TridentOrchestrator`:** By removing the `TridentOrchestrator` CR that was used to deploy Astra Trident, you instruct the operator to uninstall Trident. The operator processes the removal of `TridentOrchestrator` and proceeds to remove the Astra Trident deployment and daemonset, deleting the Trident pods it had created as part of the installation.
To completely remove Astra Trident (including the CRDs it creates) and effectively wipe the slate clean, you can edit `TridentOrchestrator` to pass the `wipeout` option. See the following example:

----
$ kubectl patch torc <trident-orchestrator-name> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"wipeout":["crds"],"uninstall":true}}'
----

This uninstalls Astra Trident completely and clears all metadata related to the backends and volumes it manages. Subsequent installations are treated as fresh installations.

WARNING: You should only consider wiping out the CRDs when performing a complete uninstallation. This cannot be undone. **Do not wipe out the CRDs unless you are looking to start over and create a fresh Astra Trident installation**.

== Uninstall by using `tridentctl`

Run the `uninstall` command in `tridentctl` as follows to removes all of the resources associated with Astra Trident except for the CRDs and related objects, thereby making it easy to run the installer again to update to a more recent version.

----
./tridentctl uninstall -n <namespace>
----

To perform a complete removal of Astra Trident, you should remove the finalizers for the CRDs created by Astra Trident and delete the CRDs.
