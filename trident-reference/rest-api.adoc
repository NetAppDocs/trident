While link:trident-reference/trident-cl.html[`tridentctl`] is the easiest way to interact with Trident's REST API, you can use the REST endpoint directly if you prefer.

This is useful for advanced installations that use Trident as a standalone binary in non-Kubernetes deployments.

For better security, Trident's `REST API` is restricted to localhost by default when running inside a pod. To change this behavior, you need to set Trident's `-address` argument in its pod configuration.

The API works as follows:

* `GET <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>`: Lists all objects of
that type.
* `GET <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>/<object-name>`: Gets
the details of the named object.
* `POST <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>`: Creates an object
of the specified type.
** Requires a JSON configuration for the object to be created. For the specification of each
object type, see link:trident-reference/tridentctl.html[`tridentctl`].
** If the object already exists, behavior varies: backends update the existing object, while all other object types will fail the
operation.
* `DELETE <trident-address>/trident/v1/<object-type>/<object-name>`: Deletes the named resource.
+
NOTE: Volumes associated with backends or storage classes will continue to exist; these must be deleted separately. For more information, see link:trident-reference/tridentctl.html[`tridentctl`].

To see an example of how these APIs are called, pass the debug (`-d`) flag to link:trident-reference/tridentctl.html[`tridentctl`].
