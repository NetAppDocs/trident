Learn about how to perform backend management operations by using `kubectl`.

== Delete a backend

By deleting a `TridentBackendConfig`, you instruct Astra Trident to delete/retain backends (based on `deletionPolicy`). To delete a backend, ensure that `deletionPolicy` is set to delete. To delete just the `TridentBackendConfig`, ensure that `deletionPolicy` is set to retain. This will ensure the backend is still present and can be managed by using `tridentctl`.

Run the following command:
----
$ kubectl delete tbc <tbc-name> -n trident
----

Astra Trident does not delete the Kubernetes Secrets that were in use by `TridentBackendConfig`. The Kubernetes user is responsible for cleaning up secrets. Care must be taken when deleting secrets. You should delete secrets only if they are not in use by the backends.

== View the existing backends

Run the following command:
----
$ kubectl get tbc -n trident
----

You can also run `tridentctl get backend -n trident` or `tridentctl get backend -o yaml -n trident` to obtain a list of all backends that exist. This list will also include backends that were created with `tridentctl`.

== Update a backend

There can be multiple reasons to update a backend:

* Credentials to the storage system have changed. To update credentials, the Kubernetes Secret that is used in the `TridentBackendConfig` object must be updated. Astra Trident will automatically update the backend with the latest credentials provided. Run the following command to update the Kubernetes Secret:
----
$ kubectl apply -f <updated-secret-file.yaml> -n trident
----
* Parameters (such as the name of the ONTAP SVM being used) need to be updated.
In this case, `TridentBackendConfig` objects can be updated directly through Kubernetes.
----
$ kubectl apply -f <updated-backend-file.yaml>
----

Alternatively, make changes to the existing `TridentBackendConfig` CR by running the following command:
----
$ kubectl edit tbc <tbc-name> -n trident
----

If a backend update fails, the backend continues to remain in its last known configuration. You can view the logs to determine the cause by running `kubectl get tbc <tbc-name> -o yaml -n trident` or `kubectl describe tbc <tbc-name> -n trident`.

After you identify and correct the problem with the configuration file, you can re-run the update command.
