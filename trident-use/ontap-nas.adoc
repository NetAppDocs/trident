== User permissions

Astra Trident expects to be run as either an ONTAP or SVM administrator, typically using the `admin` cluster user or a `vsadmin` SVM user, or a user with a different name that has the same role. For Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP deployments, Astra Trident expects to be run as either an ONTAP or SVM administrator, using the cluster `fsxadmin` user or a `vsadmin` SVM user, or a user with a different name that has the same role. The `fsxadmin` user is a limited replacement for the cluster admin user.

NOTE: If you use the `limitAggregateUsage` parameter, cluster admin permissions are required. When using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with Astra Trident, the `limitAggregateUsage` parameter will not work with the `vsadmin` and `fsxadmin` user accounts. The configuration operation will fail if you specify this parameter.
