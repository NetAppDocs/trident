Release Notes provide information about new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in the latest version of Astra Trident.

== What's new

NetApp is continually improving and enhancing its products and services. Here are some of the latest features and functionalities available with Trident.

=== Astra Trident 21.07.01

* Fixed custom YAML installer issue with different image.
* Fixed snapshot size calculation issue.

See https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v21.07.1[Trident GitHub^] for more information.

=== Astra Trident 21.07

Astra Trident 21.07.0 is *not available for download*. Changes introduced to `snapshotReserve` with version 21.07.0 can result in CSI `VolumeSnapshots` being unusable for creating PersistentVolumeClaim(s).

If you have already upgraded to version 21.07.0, it is recommended that you delete the newly created `VolumeSnapshots` (provisioned with version 21.07.0) and downgrade to the previous release.

See https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/tag/v21.07.0[Trident GitHub^] for more information.

== Known issues

Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using the product successfully.

* Trident now enforces a blank `fsType` (`fsType=""`) for volumes that do not have the `fsType` specified in their StorageClass. When working with Kubernetes 1.17 or later, Trident supports providing a blank `fsType` for NFS volumes. For iSCSI volumes, you are required to set the `fsType` on your StorageClass when enforcing an `fsGroup` using a Security Context.

* When using a backend across multiple Trident instances, each backend configuration file should have a different `storagePrefix` value for ONTAP backends or use a different `TenantName` for SolidFire backends. Trident cannot detect volumes that other instances of Trident have created. Attempting to create an existing volume on either ONTAP or SolidFire backends succeeds, because Trident treats volume creation as an idempotent operation. If `storagePrefix` or `TenantName` do not differ, there might be name collisions for volumes created on the same backend.

* When installing Trident (using `tridentctl` or the Trident Operator) and using `tridentctl` to manage Trident, you should ensure the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set. This is necessary to indicate the Kubernetes cluster that `tridentctl` should work against. When working with multiple Kubernetes environments, you should ensure that the `KUBECONFIG` file is sourced accurately.

* To perform online space reclamation for iSCSI PVs, the underlying OS on the worker node might require mount options to be passed to the volume. This is true for RHEL/RedHat CoreOS instances, which require the `discard` https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/discarding-unused-blocks_managing-file-systems[mount option^]; ensure that the discard mountOption is included in your https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[`StorageClass`^] to support online block discard.

* If you have more than one instance of Trident per Kubernetes cluster, Trident cannot communicate with other instances and cannot discover other volumes that they have created, which leads to unexpected and incorrect behavior if more than one instance runs within a cluster. There should be only one instance of Trident per Kubernetes cluster.

* If Trident-based `StorageClass` objects are deleted from Kubernetes while Trident is offline, Trident does not remove the corresponding storage classes from its database when it comes back online. You should delete these storage classes using `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* If a user deletes a PV provisioned by Trident before deleting the corresponding PVC, Trident does not automatically delete the backing volume. You should remove the volume via `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* ONTAP cannot concurrently provision more than one FlexGroup at a time unless the set of aggregates are unique to each provisioning request.

* When using Trident over IPv6, you should specify `managementLIF` and `dataLIF` in the backend definition within square brackets. For example, ``[fd20:8b1e:b258:2000:f816:3eff:feec:0]``.

* If using the `solidfire-san` driver with OpenShift 4.5, ensure that the underlying worker nodes use MD5 as the CHAP authentication algorithm. See Worker node Preparation for instructions.
