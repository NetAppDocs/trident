Trident is a fully supported open source storage provisioner and orchestrator maintained by NetApp.

Trident supports popular container platforms, such as Kubernetes and Docker. It natively integrates with Kubernetes in order to dynamically provision persistent volume requests on demand, at the time of the request. Additionally, Trident has a REST interface which can be used by any application to create and manage storage across the configured resources.
Trident is compatible with ONTAP (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), Element (NetApp HCI/SolidFire), and SANtricity (E/EF-Series) data management software, plus the Azure NetApp Files service in Azure, the Cloud Volumes Service for AWS in Amazon Web Services, and the Cloud Volumes Service for GCP in Google Cloud.
