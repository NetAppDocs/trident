[.lead]
You can upgrade Astra Trident using the Trident operator either manually or using Helm. You can upgrade from a Trident operator installation to another Trident operator installation or upgrade from a `tridentctl` installation to a Trident operator version. Review link:upgrade-trident.html#select-an-upgrade-method[Select an upgrade method] before upgrading a Trident operator installation.  

== Upgrade a manual installation
You can upgrade from a cluster-scoped Trident operator installation to another cluster-scoped Trident operator installation. All Astra Trident versions 21.01 and above use a cluster-scoped operator.

NOTE: To upgrade from Astra Trident that was installed using the namespace-scoped operator (versions 20.07 through 20.10), use the upgrade instructions for link:../earlier-versions.html[your installed version] of Astra Trident.

.About this task
Trident provides a bundle file you can use to install the operator and create associated objects for your Kubernetes version.

* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.24, use link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/v24.06/deploy/bundle_pre_1_25.yaml[bundle_pre_1_25.yaml^].

* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.25 or later, use link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/v24.06/deploy/bundle_post_1_25.yaml[bundle_post_1_25.yaml^].

.Before you begin
Ensure you are using a Kubernetes cluster running link:../trident-get-started/requirements.html[a supported Kubernetes version].

.Steps
. Verify your Astra Trident version:
+
----
./tridentctl -n trident version
----
. Delete the Trident operator that was used to install the current Astra Trident instance. For example, if you are upgrading from 23.07, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl delete -f 23.07.0/trident-installer/deploy/<bundle.yaml> -n trident
----
. If you customized your initial installation using `TridentOrchestrator` attributes, you can edit the `TridentOrchestrator` object to modify the installation parameters. This might include changes made to specify mirrored Trident and CSI image registries for offline mode, enable debug logs, or specify image pull secrets.
. Install Astra Trident using the correct bundle YAML file for your environment, where _<bundle.yaml>_ is
`bundle_pre_1_25.yaml` or `bundle_post_1_25.yaml` based on your Kubernetes version. For example, if you are installing Astra Trident 24.06, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f 24.06.0/trident-installer/deploy/<bundle.yaml> -n trident
----

== Upgrade a Helm installation
You can upgrade an Astra Trident Helm installation.  

WARNING: When upgrading a Kubernetes cluster from 1.24 to 1.25 or later that has Astra Trident installed, you must update values.yaml to set `excludePodSecurityPolicy` to `true` or add `--set excludePodSecurityPolicy=true` to the `helm upgrade` command before you can upgrade the cluster.

.Steps
. If you link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-helm.html#deploy-the-trident-operator-and-install-astra-trident-using-helm[installed Astra Trident using Helm], you can use `helm upgrade trident netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 100.2406.0` to upgrade in one step. If you did not add the Helm repo or cannot use it to upgrade:

.. Download the latest Astra Trident release from link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/latest[the _Assets_ section on GitHub^]. 
.. Use the `helm upgrade` command where `trident-operator-24.06.0.tgz` reflects the version that you want to upgrade to.
+
----
helm upgrade <name> trident-operator-24.06.0.tgz
----
NOTE: If you set custom options during the initial installation (such as specifying private, mirrored registries for Trident and CSI images), append the `helm upgrade` command using `--set` to ensure those options are included in the upgrade command, otherwise the values will reset to default. 
. Run `helm list` to verify that the chart and app version have both been upgraded. Run `tridentctl logs` to review any debug messages.

== Upgrade from a `tridentctl` installation to Trident operator
You can upgrade to the latest release of the Trident operator from a `tridentctl` installation. The existing backends and PVCs will automatically be available.

NOTE: Before switching between installation methods, review link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html#moving-between-installation-methods[Moving between installation methods].

.Steps
. Download the latest Astra Trident release.
+
----
# Download the release required [24.060.0]
mkdir 24.06.0
cd 24.06.0
wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v24.06.0/trident-installer-24.06.0.tar.gz
tar -xf trident-installer-24.06.0.tar.gz
cd trident-installer
----

. Create the `tridentorchestrator` CRD from the manifest.
+
----
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
----

. Deploy the cluster-scoped operator in the same namespace.
