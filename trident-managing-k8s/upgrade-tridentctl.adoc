You can easily upgrade an existing Astra Trident installation using `tridentctl`.

== Considerations before upgrading

Uninstalling and reinstalling Astra Trident acts as an upgrade. When you uninstall Trident, the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and Persistent Volume (PV) used by the Astra Trident deployment are not deleted. PVs that have already been provisioned will remain available while Astra Trident is offline, and Astra Trident will provision volumes for any PVCs that are created in the interim once it is back online.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading Astra Trident, do not interrupt the upgrade process. Ensure that the installer runs to completion.
