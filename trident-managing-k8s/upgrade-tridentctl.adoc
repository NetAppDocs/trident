You can easily upgrade an existing Astra Trident installation using `tridentctl`.

.About this task
Uninstalling and reinstalling Astra Trident acts as an upgrade. When you uninstall Trident, the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and Persistent Volume (PV) used by the Astra Trident deployment are not deleted. PVs that have already been provisioned will remain available while Astra Trident is offline, and Astra Trident will provision volumes for any PVCs that are created in the interim once it is back online.

.Before you begin
Review link:upgrade-trident.html#select-an-upgrade-method[Select an upgrade method] before upgrading using `tridentctl`. 

.Steps

. Run the uninstall command in `tridentctl` to remove all of the resources associated with Astra Trident except for the CRDs and related objects.

. Reinstall Astra Trident. Refer to link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-tridentctl.html[Install Astra Trident using tridentctl]. 

IMPORTANT: Do not interrupt the upgrade process. Ensure the installer runs to completion.
