Trident is an officially supported NetApp project. You can reach out to NetApp using any of the standard mechanisms and get the enterprise grade support that you need.

There is also a vibrant public community of container users (including Trident developers) on the #containers channel on http://netapp.io/slack[NetApp’s Slack team^]. This is a great place to ask general questions about the project and discuss related topics with like-minded peers.
