Learn about protection and recovery options for Astra Trident and volumes created using Astra Trident. You should have a data protection and recovery strategy for each application with a persistence requirement.

== Astra Trident replication and recovery
You can create a backup to restore Astra Trident in the event of a disaster.

=== Astra Trident replication
Astra Trident uses Kubernetes CRDs to store and manage its own state and the Kubernetes cluster etcd to store its metadata. 

.Steps

. Back up the Kubernetes cluster etcd using  link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster[Kubernetes: Backing up an etcd cluster^].
. Place the backup artifacts on a FlexVol. 
+
NOTE: We recommend you protect the SVM where the FlexVol resides with a SnapMirror relationship to another SVM.

=== Astra Trident recovery
Using Kubernetes CRDs and the Kubernetes cluster etcd snapshot, you can recover Astra Trident.

.Steps
. From the destination SVM, mount the volume which contains the Kubernetes etcd data files and certificates on to the host which will be set up as a master node.

. Copy all required certificates pertaining to the Kubernetes cluster under `/etc/kubernetes/pki` and the etcd member files under `/var/lib/etcd`.

. Restore the Kubernetes cluster from the etcd backup using link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#restoring-an-etcd-cluster[Kubernetes: Restoring an etcd cluster^].

. Run `kubectl get crd` to verify all Trident custom resources have come up and retrieve the Trident objects to verify all data is available.

== SVM replication and recovery
Astra Trident cannot configure replication relationships, however, the storage administrator can use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/snapmirror-svm-replication-concept.html[ONTAP SnapMirror^] to replicate an SVM. 

In the event of a disaster, you can activate the SnapMirror destination SVM to start serving data. You can switch back to the primary when systems are restored.

.About this task
Consider the following when using the SnapMirror SVM Replication feature:

* You should create a distinct backend for each SVM with SVM-DR enabled.

* Configure the storage classes to select the replicated backends only when needed to avoid having volumes which do not need replication provisioned onto the backends that support SVM-DR.

* Application administrators should understand the additional cost and complexity associated with replication and carefully consider their recovery plan prior to beginning this process.

=== SVM replication 
You can use link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/snapmirror-svm-replication-workflow-concept.html[ONTAP: SnapMirror SVM replication^] to create the SVM replication relationship.

SnapMirror allows you to set options to control what to replicate. You'll need to know which options you selected when preforming <<SVM recovery using Astra Trident>>.

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/replicate-entire-svm-config-task.html[-identity-preserve true^] replicates the entire SVM configuration. 
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/exclude-lifs-svm-replication-task.html[-discard-configs network^] excludes LIFs and related network settings.  
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/exclude-network-name-service-svm-replication-task.html[-identity-preserve false^] replicates only the volumes and security configuration.  

=== SVM recovery using Astra Trident
Astra Trident does not automatically detect SVM failures. In the event of a disaster, the administrator can manually initiate Trident failover to the new SVM.

.Steps

. Cancel scheduled and ongoing SnapMirror transfers, break the replication relationship, stop the source SVM and then activate the SnapMirror destination SVM.
. If you specified `-identity-preserve false` or `-discard-config network` when configuring your SVM replication,  update the `managementLIF` and `dataLIF` in the Trident backend definition file. 
. Confirm `storagePrefix` is present in the Trident backend definition file. This parameter cannot be changed. Omitting `storagePrefix` will cause the backend update to fail.  
. Update all the required backends to reflect the new destination SVM name using:
+
----
./tridentctl update backend <backend-name> -f <backend-json-file> -n <namespace>
----
. If you specified `-identity-preserve false` or `discard-config network`, you must bounce all application pods.  
+
NOTE: If you specified `-identity-preserve true`, all volumes provisioned by Astra Trident start serving data when the destination SVM is activated.

== Volume replication and recovery
Astra Trident cannot configure SnapMirror replication relationships, however, the storage administrator can use link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/snapmirror-disaster-recovery-concept.html[ONTAP SnapMirror replication and recovery^] to replicate volumes created by Astra Trident.  

You can then import the recovered volumes into Astra Trident using link:../trident-use/vol-import.html[tridentctl volume import].

NOTE: Import is not supported on `ontap-nas-economy`,  `ontap-san-economy`, or `ontap-flexgroup-economy` drivers.

== Snapshot data protection 
You can protect and restore data using: 

* An external snapshot controller and CRDs to create Kubernetes volume snapshots of Persistent Volumes (PVs). 
+
link:../trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[Volume snapshots]

* ONTAP Snapshots  to restore the entire contents of a volume or to recover individual files or LUNs. 
+
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/manage-local-snapshot-copies-concept.html[ONTAP Snapshots^]

== Astra Control Center application replication
Using Astra Control, you can replicate data and application changes from one cluster to another using asynchronous replication capabilities of SnapMirror.
