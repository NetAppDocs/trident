A backend defines the relationship between Astra Trident and a storage system. It tells Astra Trident how to communicate with that storage system and how Astra Trident should provision volumes from it. After Astra Trident is installed, the next step is to create a backend. The `TridentBackendConfig` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) enables you to create and manage Trident backends directly through the Kubernetes interface. You can do this by using `kubectl` or the equivalent CLI tool for your Kubernetes distribution.

== `TridentBackendConfig`

`TridentBackendConfig` (`tbc`, `tbconfig`, `tbackendconfig`) is a frontend, namespaced CRD that enables you to manage Astra Trident backends using `kubectl`. Kubernetes and storage admins can now create and manage backends directly through the Kubernetes CLI without requiring a dedicated command-line utility (`tridentctl`).

Upon the creation of a `TridentBackendConfig` object, the following happens:

* A backend is created automatically by Astra Trident based on the configuration you provide. This is represented internally as a `TridentBackend` (`tbe`, `tridentbackend`) CR.
* The `TridentBackendConfig` is uniquely bound to a `TridentBackend` that was created by Astra Trident.

Each `TridentBackendConfig` maintains a one-to-one mapping with a `TridentBackend`. The former is the interface provided to the user to design and configure backends; the latter is how Trident represents the actual backend object.

WARNING: `TridentBackend` CRs are created automatically by Astra Trident. You *should not* modify them. If you want to make updates to backends, do this by modifying the `TridentBackendConfig` object.

See the following example for the format of the `TridentBackendConfig` CR:
----
apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: TridentBackendConfig
metadata:
  name: backend-tbc-ontap-san
spec:
  version: 1
  backendName: ontap-san-backend
  storageDriverName: ontap-san
  managementLIF: 10.0.0.1
  dataLIF: 10.0.0.2
  svm: trident_svm
  credentials:
    name: backend-tbc-ontap-san-secret
----

You can also take a look at the examples in the https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/v21.07/trident-installer/sample-input/backends-samples[trident-installer^] directory for sample configurations for the desired storage platform/service.

The `spec` takes backend-specific configuration parameters. In this example, the backend uses the `ontap-san` storage driver and uses the configuration parameters that are tabulated here. For the list of configuration options for your desired storage driver, see the link:backends.html[backend configuration information for your storage driver^].

The `spec` section also includes `credentials` and `deletionPolicy` fields, which are newly introduced in the `TridentBackendConfig` CR:

* `credentials`: This parameter is a required field and contains the credentials used to authenticate with the storage system/service. This is set to a user-created Kubernetes Secret. The credentials cannot be passed in plain text and will result in an error.
* `deletionPolicy`: This field defines what should happen when the `TridentBackendConfig` is deleted. It can take one of two possible values:
** `delete`: This results in the deletion of both `TridentBackendConfig` CR and the associated backend. This is the default value.
** `retain`: When a `TridentBackendConfig` CR is deleted, the backend definition will still be present and can be managed with `tridentctl`. Setting the deletion policy to `retain` lets users downgrade to an earlier release (pre-21.04) and retain the created backends. The value for this field can be updated after a `TridentBackendConfig` is created.

NOTE: The name of a backend is set using `spec.backendName`. If unspecified, the name of the backend is set to the name of the `TridentBackendConfig` object (metadata.name). It is recommended to explicitly set backend names using `spec.backendName`.

TIP: Backends that were created with `tridentctl` do not have an associated `TridentBackendConfig` object. You can choose to manage such backends with `kubectl` by creating a `TridentBackendConfig` CR. Care must be taken to specify identical config parameters (such as `spec.backendName`, `spec.storagePrefix`, `spec.storageDriverName`, and so on). Astra Trident will automatically bind the newly-created `TridentBackendConfig` with the pre-existing backend.

== Steps overview

To create a new backend by using `kubectl`, you should do the following:

. Create a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secret^]. The secret contains the credentials Astra Trident needs to communicate with the storage cluster/service.
. Create a `TridentBackendConfig` object. This contains specifics about the storage cluster/service and references the secret created in the previous step.

After you create a backend, you can observe its status by using `kubectl get tbc <tbc-name> -n <trident-namespace>` and gather additional details.

== Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Secret

Create a Secret that contains the access credentials for the backend. This is unique to each storage service/platform. Here’s an example:
----
$ kubectl -n trident create -f backend-tbc-ontap-san-secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backend-tbc-ontap-san-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: cluster-admin
  password: t@Ax@7q(>
----

This table summarizes the fields that must be included in the Secret for each storage platform:

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
|Storage platform	Secret Fields	description
|Secret
|Fields	description

|Azure NetApp Files
a|clientID
a|The client ID from an app registration

|Cloud Volumes Service for GCP
a|private_key_id
a|ID of the private key. Part of API key for GCP Service Account with CVS admin role

|Cloud Volumes Service for GCP
a|private_key
a|Private key. Part of API key for GCP Service Account with CVS admin role

|Element (NetApp HCI/SolidFire)
a|Endpoint
a|MVIP for the SolidFire cluster with tenant credentials

|ONTAP
a|username
a|Username to connect to the cluster/SVM. Used for credential-based authentication

|ONTAP
a|password
a|Password to connect to the cluster/SVM. Used for credential-based authentication

|ONTAP
a|clientPrivateKey
a|Base64-encoded value of client private key. Used for certificate-based authentication

|ONTAP
a|chapUsername
a|Inbound username. Required if useCHAP=true. For `ontap-san` and `ontap-san-economy`

|ONTAP
a|chapInitiatorSecret
a|CHAP initiator secret. Required if useCHAP=true. For `ontap-san` and `ontap-san-economy`

|ONTAP
a|chapTargetUsername
a|Target username. Required if useCHAP=true. For `ontap-san` and `ontap-san-economy`

|ONTAP
a|chapTargetInitiatorSecret
a|CHAP target initiator secret. Required if useCHAP=true. For `ontap-san` and `ontap-san-economy`

|===

The Secret created in this step will be referenced in the `spec.credentials` field of the `TridentBackendConfig` object that is created in the next step.

== Step 2: Create the `TridentBackendConfig` CR

You are now ready to create your `TridentBackendConfig` CR. In this example, a backend that uses the `ontap-san` driver is created by using the `TridentBackendConfig` object shown below:

----
$ kubectl -n trident create -f backend-tbc-ontap-san.yaml
----

----
apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: TridentBackendConfig
metadata:
  name: backend-tbc-ontap-san
spec:
  version: 1
  backendName: ontap-san-backend
  storageDriverName: ontap-san
  managementLIF: 10.0.0.1
  dataLIF: 10.0.0.2
  svm: trident_svm
  credentials:
    name: backend-tbc-ontap-san-secret
----

== Step 3: Verify the status of the `TridentBackendConfig` CR

Now that you created the `TridentBackendConfig` CR, you can verify the status. See the following example:

----
$ kubectl -n trident get tbc backend-tbc-ontap-san
NAME                    BACKEND NAME          BACKEND UUID                           PHASE   STATUS
backend-tbc-ontap-san   ontap-san-backend     8d24fce7-6f60-4d4a-8ef6-bab2699e6ab8   Bound   Success
----

A backend was successfully created and bound to the `TridentBackendConfig` CR.

Phase can take one of the following values:

* `Bound`: The `TridentBackendConfig` CR is associated with a backend, and that backend contains `configRef` set to the `TridentBackendConfig` CR’s uid.
* `Unbound`: Represented using `""`. The `TridentBackendConfig` object is not bound to a backend. All newly created `TridentBackendConfig` CRs are in this phase by default. After the phase changes, it cannot revert to Unbound again.
* `Deleting`: The `TridentBackendConfig` CR’s `deletionPolicy` was set to delete. When the `TridentBackendConfig` CR is deleted, it transitions to the Deleting state.
** If no persistent volume claims (PVCs) exist on the backend, deleting the `TridentBackendConfig` will result in Astra Trident deleting the backend as well as the `TridentBackendConfig` CR.
** If one or more PVCs are present on the backend, it goes to a deleting state. The `TridentBackendConfig` CR subsequently also enters deleting phase. The backend and `TridentBackendConfig` are deleted only after all PVCs are deleted.
* `Lost`: The backend associated with the `TridentBackendConfig` CR was accidentally or deliberately deleted and the `TridentBackendConfig` CR still has a reference to the deleted backend. The `TridentBackendConfig` CR can still be deleted irrespective of the `deletionPolicy` value.
* `Unknown`: Astra Trident is unable to determine the state or existence of the backend associated with the `TridentBackendConfig` CR. For example, if the API server is not responding or if the `tridentbackends.trident.netapp.io` CRD is missing. This might require the user’s intervention.

At this stage, a backend is successfully created! There are several operations that can additionally be handled, such as link:backend_ops_kubectl.html[backend updates and backend deletions^].

== (Optional) Step 4: Get more details

You can run the following command to get more information about your backend:
----
kubectl -n trident get tbc backend-tbc-ontap-san -o wide
----

----
NAME                    BACKEND NAME        BACKEND UUID                           PHASE   STATUS    STORAGE DRIVER   DELETION POLICY
backend-tbc-ontap-san   ontap-san-backend   8d24fce7-6f60-4d4a-8ef6-bab2699e6ab8   Bound   Success   ontap-san        delete
----

In addition, you can also obtain a YAML/JSON dump of `TridentBackendConfig`.
----
$ kubectl -n trident get tbc backend-tbc-ontap-san -o yaml
----

----

  lastOperationStatus: Success
  message: Backend 'ontap-san-backend' created
  phase: Bound
----

`backendInfo` contains the `backendName` and the `backendUUID` of the backend that got created in response to the `TridentBackendConfig` CR. The `lastOperationStatus` field represents the status of the last operation of the `TridentBackendConfig` CR, which can be user-triggered (for example, user changed something in `spec`) or triggered by Astra Trident (for example, during Astra Trident restarts). It can either be Success or Failed. `phase` represents the status of the relation between the `TridentBackendConfig` CR and the backend. In the example above, `phase` has the value Bound, which means that the `TridentBackendConfig` CR is associated with the backend.

You can run the `kubectl -n trident describe tbc <tbc-cr-name>` command to get details of the event logs.

WARNING: You cannot update or delete a backend which contains an associated `TridentBackendConfig` object using `tridentctl`. To understand the steps involved in switching between `tridentctl` and `TridentBackendConfig`, link:backend_options.html[see here^].
