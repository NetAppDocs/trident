A Trident backend defines the relationship between Trident and a storage system. It tells Trident how to communicate with that storage system and how Trident should provision volumes from it.

To get started with configuring the backend, select the storage system type that you plan to use:

* link:anf.html[Azure NetApp Files]
* link:aws.html[Cloud Volumes Service for AWS]
* link:gcp.html[Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud]

After you configure the backend, you can manage it:

* link:manage-backend.html[Manage the backend]
