summary: All of the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster need to be able to mount the volumes that you have provisioned for your pods. If you are using the ontap-nas, ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup driver for one of your backends, your worker nodes need the NFS tools. Otherwise they require the iSCSI tools.

= Prepare the worker node

[.lead]
All worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must be able to mount the volumes you have provisioned for your pods. To prepare the worker nodes, you must install NFS, iSCSI, or NVMe/TCP tools based on your driver selection. 

== Selecting the right tools 
If you are using a combination of drivers, you should install all required tools for your drivers. Recent versions of RedHat CoreOS have the tools installed by default.  

.NFS tools
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/worker-node-prep.html#nfs-volumes[Install the NFS tools] if you are using: `ontap-nas`, `ontap-nas-economy`, `ontap-nas-flexgroup`, `azure-netapp-files`, `gcp-cvs`.

.iSCSI tools
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/worker-node-prep.html#install-the-iscsi-tools[Install the iSCSI tools] if you are using: `ontap-san`, `ontap-san-economy`, `solidfire-san`.

.NVMe tools
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/worker-node-prep.html#nvmetcp-volumes[Install the NVMe tools] if you are using `ontap-san` for nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) over TCP (NVMe/TCP) protocol. 

NOTE: We recommend ONTAP 9.12 or later for NVMe/TCP. 

== Node service discovery

Astra Trident attempts to automatically detect if the node can run iSCSI or NFS services. 

NOTE: Node service discovery identifies discovered services but does not guarantee services are properly configured. Conversely, the absence of a discovered service does not guarantee the volume mount will fail.

.Review events
Astra Trident creates events for the node to identify the discovered services. To review these events, run:

----
kubectl get event -A --field-selector involvedObject.name=<Kubernetes node name>
----

.Review discovered services
Astra Trident identifies services enabled for each node on the Trident node CR. To view the discovered services, run: 

----
tridentctl get node -o wide -n <Trident namespace>
----

== NFS volumes
Install the NFS tools using the commands for your operating system. Ensure the NFS service is started up during boot time.

WARNING: Reboot your worker nodes after installing the NFS tools to prevent failure when attaching volumes to containers.

== iSCSI volumes
Astra Trident can automatically establish an iSCSI session, scan LUNs, and discover multipath devices, format them, and mount them to a pod. 

=== iSCSI self-healing capabilities
For ONTAP systems, Astra Trident runs iSCSI self-healing every five minutes to:

. *Identify* the desired iSCSI session state and the current iSCSI session state. 
. *Compare* the desired state to the current state to identify needed repairs. Astra Trident determines repair priorities and when to preempt repairs. 
. *Perform repairs* required to return the current iSCSI session state to the desired iSCSI session state. 

NOTE: Logs of self-healing activity are located in the `trident-main` container on the respective Daemonset pod. To view logs, you must have set `debug` to "true" during Astra Trident installation.

Astra Trident iSCSI self-healing capabilities can help prevent:

* Stale or unhealthy iSCSI sessions that could occur after a network connectivity issue. In the case of a stale session, Astra Trident waits seven minutes before logging out to reestablish the connection with a portal.
+
NOTE: For example, if CHAP secrets were rotated on the storage controller and the network loses connectivity, the old (_stale_) CHAP secrets could persist. Self-healing can recognize this and automatically reestablish the session to apply the updated CHAP secrets. 
* Missing iSCSI sessions
* Missing LUNs

*Points to consider before upgrading Trident*

 * If only per-node igroups (introduced in 23.04+) are in use, iSCSI self-healing will initiate SCSI rescans for all devices in the SCSI bus.
 * If only backend-scoped igroups (deprecated as of 23.04) are in use, iSCSI self-healing will initiate SCSI rescans for exact LUN IDs in the SCSI bus. 
 * If a mix of per-node igroups and backend-scoped igroups are in use, iSCSI self-healing will initiate SCSI rescans for exact LUN IDs in the SCSI bus. 

=== Install the iSCSI tools
Install the iSCSI tools using the commands for your operating system.  

.Before you begin
* Each node in the Kubernetes cluster must have a unique IQN. *This is a necessary prerequisite*.
* If using RHCOS version 4.5 or later, or other RHEL-compatible Linux distribution, with the `solidfire-san` driver and Element OS 12.5 or earlier, ensure that the CHAP authentication algorithm is set to MD5 in `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf`. Secure FIPS-compliant CHAP algorithms SHA1, SHA-256, and SHA3-256 are available with Element 12.7.
+
----
sudo sed -i 's/^\(node.session.auth.chap_algs\).*/\1 = MD5/' /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf
----
* When using worker nodes that run RHEL/RedHat CoreOS with iSCSI PVs, specify the `discard` mountOption in the StorageClass to perform inline space reclamation. Refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/discarding-unused-blocks_managing-file-systems[RedHat documentation^].

=== Configure or disable iSCSI self healing

You can configure the following Astra Trident iSCSI self-healing settings to fix stale sessions:

* *iSCSI self-healing interval*: Determines the frequency at which iSCSI self-healing is invoked (default: 5 minutes). You can configure it to run more frequently by setting a smaller number or less frequently by setting a larger number.

[NOTE]
====
Setting the iSCSI self-healing interval to 0 stops iSCSI self-healing completely. We do not recommend disabling iSCSI Self-healing; it should only be disabled in certain scenarios when iSCSI self-healing is not working as intended or for debugging purposes.
====

* *iSCSI Self-Healing Wait Time*: Determines the duration iSCSI self-healing waits before logging out of an unhealthy session and trying to log in again (default: 7 minutes). You can configure it to a larger number so that sessions that are identified as unhealthy have to wait longer before being logged out and then an attempt is made to log back in, or a smaller number to log out and log in earlier.

.Helm
--
To configure or change iSCSI self-healing settings, pass the `iscsiSelfHealingInterval` and `iscsiSelfHealingWaitTime` parameters during the helm installation or helm update.

The following example sets the iSCSI self-healing interval to 3 minutes and self-healing wait time to 6 minutes:
----
helm install trident trident-operator-100.2406.0.tgz --set iscsiSelfHealingInterval=3m0s --set iscsiSelfHealingWaitTime=6m0s -n trident
----
--
.tridentctl
--
To configure or change iSCSI self-healing settings, pass the `iscsi-self-healing-interval` and `iscsi-self-healing-wait-time` parameters during the tridentctl installation or update.

The following example sets the iSCSI self-healing interval to 3 minutes and self-healing wait time to 6 minutes:
----
tridentctl install --iscsi-self-healing-interval=3m0s --iscsi-self-healing-wait-time=6m0s -n trident
----

====

== NVMe/TCP volumes
Install the NVMe tools using the commands for your operating system.

[NOTE]
====
* NVMe requires RHEL 9 or later. 
* If the kernel version of your Kubernetes node is too old or if the NVMe package is not available for your kernel version, you might have to update the kernel version of your node to one with the NVMe package.

=== Verify installation
After installation, verify that each node in the Kubernetes cluster has a unique NQN using the command:
----
cat /etc/nvme/hostnqn
----

WARNING: Astra Trident modifies the `ctrl_device_tmo` value to ensure NVMe doesn't give up on the path if it goes down. Do not change this setting.
