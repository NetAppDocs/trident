summary: If you are just getting started with Kubernetes, use the instructions to install Kubernetes to try it out. These instructions provide a bare-bones, single-node cluster that Trident can integrate with for demonstration purposes.

= Quick start for Astra Trident

[.lead]
You can install Astra Trident and get start managing storage resources in a few steps. Before getting started, review link:requirements.html[Astra Trident requirements].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Install Astra Trident
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Astra Trident offers several installation methods and modes optimized for a variety of environments and organizations.

NOTE: For Docker, refer to link:../trident-docker/deploy-docker.html[Astra Trident for Docker].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Prepare the worker node
[role="quick-margin-para"]
All worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must be able to mount the volumes you have provisioned for your pods.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Create a backend
[role="quick-margin-para"]
A backend defines the relationship between Astra Trident and a storage system. It tells Astra Trident how to communicate with that storage system and how Astra Trident should provision volumes from it.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Create a storage class
[role="quick-margin-para"]
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[Kubernetes StorageClass objects^] are specified by name in `PersistentVolumeClaims` to provision storage with a set of properties. The storage class itself identifies the provisioner to be used and defines that set of properties in terms the provisioner understands.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Provision your first volume
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Now you are ready to dynamically provision your first volume. This is done by creating a Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes[persistent volume claim^] (PVC) object. Make sure the storage class name matches the one that you created.

// Create a PVC for a volume that uses the storage class that you just created.

// See `sample-input/pvc-basic-csi.yaml` for an example. Make sure the storage class name matches the one that you created.
// ----
// kubectl create -f sample-input/pvc-basic-csi.yaml

// kubectl get pvc --watch
// NAME      STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES  STORAGECLASS   AGE
// basic     Pending                                                                       basic          1s
// basic     Pending   pvc-3acb0d1c-b1ae-11e9-8d9f-5254004dfdb7   0                        basic          5s
// basic     Bound     pvc-3acb0d1c-b1ae-11e9-8d9f-5254004dfdb7   1Gi        RWO           basic          7s

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Mount the volumes in a pod
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Now let us mount the volume. We will launch an nginx pod that mounts the PV under `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
----
cat << EOF > task-pv-pod.yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
       claimName: basic
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage
EOF
kubectl create -f task-pv-pod.yaml
----
----
# Wait for the pod to start
kubectl get pod --watch

# Verify that the volume is mounted on /usr/share/nginx/html
kubectl exec -it task-pv-pod -- df -h /usr/share/nginx/html

# Delete the pod
kubectl delete pod task-pv-pod
----

At this point, the pod (application) no longer exists but the volume is still there. You can use it from another pod if you want to.

To delete the volume, delete the claim:
----
kubectl delete pvc basic
----

== What's next?
You can now add additional backends, manage storage classes, manage backends, and perform volume operations.
