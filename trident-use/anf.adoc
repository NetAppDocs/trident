You can configure Azure NetApp Files (ANF) as the backend for Astra Trident. You can attach NAS and SMB volumes using an ANF backend.

* link:anf-examples.html[Configuration options and examples]

== Considerations

* The Azure NetApp Files service does not support volumes smaller than 100 GB. Astra Trident automatically creates 100-GB volumes if a smaller volume is requested.

* When creating a Kubernetes cluster for SMB volumes, the controlling node must be Linux and the worker node should be a Windows node. Astra Trident supports SMB volumes mounted on Windows nodes only.

* Astra Trident does not support Windows ARM architecture.
