You can safely upgrade Astra Trident for Docker without any impact to volumes that are in use. During the upgrade process there will be a brief period where `docker volume` commands directed at the plugin will not succeed, and applications will be unable to mount volumes until the plugin is running again. Under most circumstances, this is a matter of seconds.

----

+
----
docker plugin upgrade --skip-remote-check --grant-all-permissions netapp:latest netapp/trident-plugin:21.07

+
----
docker plugin enable netapp:latest
----
. Verify that the plugin is enabled:
+

docker plugin ls
ID                  NAME                DESCRIPTION                             ENABLED

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading from an old version of Astra Trident (pre-20.10) to Astra Trident 20.10 or later, you might run into an error. For more information, see link:known-issues-docker.html[Known Issues^]. If you run into the error, you should first disable the plugin, then remove the plugin, and then install the required Astra Trident version by passing an extra config parameter: `docker plugin install netapp/trident-plugin:20.10 --alias netapp --grant-all-permissions config=config.json`
