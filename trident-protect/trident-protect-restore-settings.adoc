You can customize restore operations using advanced settings such as annotations, namespace settings, and storage options to meet your specific requirements.

== ##Supported fields##
This section describes additional fields available for restore operations.

=== Storage class mapping
The `spec.storageClassMapping` attribute defines a mapping from a storage class present in the source application to a new storage class on the target cluster. You can use this when migrating applications between clusters with different storage classes or when changing the storage backend for BackupRestore operations.

*Example:*
[source,yaml]
----
storageClassMapping:
  - destination: "destinationStorageClass1"
    source: "sourceStorageClass1"
  - destination: "destinationStorageClass2"
    source: "sourceStorageClass2"
----

== Supported annotations
This section lists the supported annotations for configuring various behaviors in the system. If an annotation is not explicitly set by the user, the system will use the default value.
