You can easily upgrade an existing Astra Trident installation using the operator.

.What you'll need

To upgrade by using the operator, the following conditions should be met:

* You should have a CSI-based Astra Trident installation. To check if you are running CSI Trident, examine the pods in your Trident namespace. If they follow the `trident-csi-*` naming pattern, you are running CSI Trident.
* You should have a CRD-based Trident installation. This represents all releases from 19.07 and later. If you have a CSI-based installation, you most likely have a CRD-based installation.
* If you have uninstalled CSI Trident and the metadata from the installation persists, you can upgrade by using the operator.
* Only one Astra Trident installation should exist across all the namespaces in a given Kubernetes cluster.
* You should be using a Kubernetes cluster that runs link:../trident-get-started/requirements.html[a supported Kubernetes version].
* If alpha snapshot CRDs are present, you should remove them with `tridentctl obliviate alpha-snapshot-crd`. This deletes the CRDs for the alpha snapshot spec. For existing snapshots that should be deleted/migrated, see https://netapp.io/2020/01/30/alpha-to-beta-snapshots/[this blog^].

WARNING: When upgrading Trident by using the operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you should upgrade to Trident 21.01.1 or later. The Trident operator released with 21.01.0 contains a known issue that has been fixed in 21.01.1. For more details, see the https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/517[issue details on GitHub^].

== Upgrade a cluster-scoped operator installation

Follow these steps to upgrade from *Trident 21.01 and later*.

.Steps
. Delete the Trident operator that was used to install the current Astra Trident instance. For example, if you are upgrading from 21.01, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl delete -f 22.01/trident-installer/deploy/BUNDLE.YAML -n trident
----
. Optionally, you can edit the `TridentOrchestrator` object that you created when installing Trident to modify the installation parameters. This can include changes such as modifying the custom Trident image, private image registry to pull container images from, enabling debug logs, or specifying image pull secrets.
. Install Astra Trident by using the correct bundle YAML file for your environment and Astra Trident version from `\https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/_vXX.XX_/deploy/_BUNDLE.YAML_` where `_vXX.XX_` is the version number (for example `v22.10`) and `_BUNDLE.YAML_` is the bundle YAML file name. 
+
[NOTE]
=====

* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.24 or lower, use link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/v22.10/deploy/bundle_pre_1_25.yaml[bundle_pre_1_25.yaml^].
* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.25 or higher, use link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/v22.10/deploy/bundle_post_1_25.yaml[bundle_post_1_25.yaml^].
=====
+
For example, if you are installing Astra Trident 22.10 for Kubernetes 1.25, run the following command:
+
----
kubectl create -f 22.10.0/trident-installer/deploy/bundle_post_1_25.yaml -n trident
----
+
As part of this step, the Trident operator will identify an existing Astra Trident installation and upgrade it to the same version as the operator.

== Upgrade a namespace-scoped operator installation

To upgrade from an instance of Astra Trident installed using the namespace-scoped operator (versions 20.07 through 20.10), here is the set of steps to be followed:

.Steps
. Verify the status of the existing Trident installation. To do this, check the *Status* of  `TridentProvisioner`. The status should be `Installed`.
+
----
kubectl describe tprov trident -n trident | grep Message: -A 3
Message:  Trident installed
Status:   Installed
Version:  v20.10.1
----
+
NOTE:  If status shows `Updating`, ensure you resolve it before proceeding. For a list of possible status values, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[here^].
. Create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD by using the manifest provided with the Trident installer.
+
----
# Download the release required [22.10.0]
mkdir 22.10.0
cd 22.10.0
wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v22.10.0/trident-installer-22.10.0.tar.gz
tar -xf trident-installer-22.10.0.tar.gz
cd trident-installer
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
----
. Delete the namespace-scoped operator by using its manifest. To complete this step, you need the bundle YAML file used to deploy the namespace-scoped operator from `\https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/stable/_vXX.XX_/deploy/_BUNDLE.YAML_` where `_vXX.XX_` is the version number (for example `v22.10`) and `_BUNDLE.YAML_` is the bundle YAML file name.
+
NOTE: You should make the necessary changes to the Trident install parameters (for example, changing the values for `tridentImage`, `autosupportImage`, private image repository, and providing `imagePullSecrets`) after deleting the namespace-scoped operator and before installing the cluster-scoped operator. For a complete list of parameters that can be updated, refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-customize-deploy.html#configuration-options[configuration options].
+
----
#Ensure you are in the right directory

----
+
At this stage, the `trident-operator-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx` pod is deleted.

. (Optional) If the install parameters need to be modified, update the `TridentProvisioner` spec. These could be changes such as modifying the private image registry to pull container images from, enabling debug logs, or specifying image pull secrets.
+
----
kubectl patch tprov <trident-provisioner-name> -n <trident-namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"debug":true}}'
----
. Install the cluster-scoped operator.
+
NOTE: Installing the cluster-scoped operator initiates the migration of `TridentProvisioner` objects to `TridentOrchestrator` objects, deletes `TridentProvisioner` objects and the `tridentprovisioner` CRD, and upgrades Astra Trident to the version of the cluster-scoped operator being used. In the example that follows, Trident is upgraded to 22.10.0.
+
IMPORTANT: Upgrading Astra Trident by using the cluster-scoped operator results in the migration of `tridentProvisioner` to a `tridentOrchestrator` object with the same name. This is automatically handled by the operator. The upgrade will also have Astra Trident installed in the same namespace as before.

== Upgrade a Helm-based operator installation

Perform the following steps to upgrade a Helm-based operator installation.

.Steps
. Download the latest Astra Trident release.
. Use the `helm upgrade` command. See the following example:
+
----
helm upgrade <name> trident-operator-22.10.0.tgz
----
+
where `trident-operator-22.10.0.tgz` reflects the version that you want to upgrade to.
. Run `helm list` to verify that the chart and app version have both been upgraded.

NOTE: To pass configuration data during the upgrade, use `--set`.

For example, to change the default value of `tridentDebug`, run the following command:
----
helm upgrade <name> trident-operator-22.10.0-custom.tgz --set tridentDebug=true
----

If you run `tridentctl logs`, you can see the debug messages.

NOTE: If you set any non-default options during the initial installation, ensure that the options are included in the upgrade command, or else, the values will be reset to their defaults.

== Upgrade from a non-operator installation

If you have a CSI Trident instance that meets the prerequisites listed above, you can upgrade to the latest release of the Trident operator.

.Steps
. Download the latest Astra Trident release.
+
----
# Download the release required [22.10.0]
mkdir 22.10.0
cd 22.10.0
wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v22.10.0/trident-installer-22.10.0.tar.gz
tar -xf trident-installer-22.10.0.tar.gz

. Create the `tridentorchestrator` CRD from the manifest.
+
----
