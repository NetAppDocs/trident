[.lead]
The kube-state-metrics service is an open source tool that generates metrics from Kubernetes API communication. Using it with Trident protect exposes useful information about the state of resources in your environment.

Prometheus is an open source monitoring toolkit that can ingest the data generated by kube-state-metrics and present it as easily readable information about these objects. Together, kube-state-metrics and Prometheus provide a way for you to monitor the health and status of the resources you are managing with Trident protect. 

NOTE: The configurations included in these steps are only examples; you will need to customize them to match your environment. Refer to the official https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/main[kube-state-metrics^] and https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus^] documentation for specific instructions and support.

== Set up custom resource monitoring for Trident protect
To enable resource monitoring, you need to install and configure kube-state-metrics and Promethus separately, and configure them to work together.

.Steps
. Add the kube-state-metrics Helm chart. For example:
+
[source,console]
----
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
----

. Create a configuration file for the Helm chart (for example, `metrics-config.yaml`). You can customize the following example configuration to match your environment:
+
.metrics-config.yaml: kube-state-metrics Helm chart configuration
[source,yaml]
----
---
extraArgs:
  # Collect only custom metrics
  - --custom-resource-state-only=true

customResourceState:
  enabled: true
  config:
    kind: CustomResourceStateMetrics
    spec:
      resources:
      - groupVersionKind:
          group: astra.netapp.io
          kind: "Backup"
          version: "v1"
        labelsFromPath:
          backup_uid: [metadata, uid]
          backup_name: [metadata, name]
          creation_time: [metadata, creationTimestamp]
        metrics:
        - name: backup_info
          help: "Exposes details about the Backup state"
          each:
            type: Info
            info:
              labelsFromPath:
                appVaultReference: ["spec", "appVaultRef"]
                appReference: ["spec", "applicationRef"]
rbac:
  extraRules:
  - apiGroups: ["backups.astra.netapp.io"]
    resources: ["backups"]
    verbs: ["list", "watch"]
 
# Collect metrics from all namespaces
namespaces: ""
 
# Ensure that the metrics are collected by Prometheus
prometheus:
  monitor:
    enabled: true
----

. Install kube-state-metrics by deploying the Helm chart. For example:
+
[source,console]
----
helm install custom-resource -f metrics-config.yaml prometheus-community/kube-state-metrics --version 5.21.0
----

. Install Prometheus. Refer to the https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/[official Prometheus documentation^] for Prometheus installation instructions.

. Integrate kube-state-metrics with Prometheus. Edit the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) and add the kube-state-metrics service information. For example:
+
.prometheus.yml: kube-state-metrics service integration with Prometheus
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
  namespace: astra-connector
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'kube-state-metrics'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['kube-state-metrics.astra-connector.svc:8080']
----

. Configure Prometheus to send alerts to the Trident protect Alertmanager. Edit the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) and add the following section:
+
.prometheus.yml: Send alerts to Alertmanager
[source,yaml]
----
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['alertmanager.astra-connector.svc:9093']
----

.Result 
Prometheus now gathers metrics from kube-state-metrics, and creates alerts from the data. You can now configure when Prometheus should trigger alerts based on the metrics data.

== Send Prometheus alerts to other channels
You can configure Alertmanager to send notifications to other channels, such as e-mail, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, or other notification services by specifying the respective configuration in the `alertmanager.yml` file.

The following example configures Prometheus to send notifications to a Slack channel. To customize this example to your environment, replace the value of the `api_url` key with the Slack webhook URL used in your environment:
.alertmanager.yml: Send alerts to a Slack channel
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  alertmanager.yml: |
    global:
      resolve_timeout: 5m
    route:
      receiver: 'slack-notifications'
    receivers:
      - name: 'slack-notifications'
        slack_configs:
          - api_url: '<your-slack-webhook-url>'
            channel: '#failed-backups-channel'
            send_resolved: false
----

== Prometheus alert examples
The following configuration examples cover common alerting scenarios that you can explore with Prometheus.

=== Backup alert example
The following example defines a critical alert that is triggered when the status of the backup custom resource is set to `Error` for 5 seconds or longer. You can customize this example to match your environment, and include this YAML snippet in your `prometheus.yml` configuration file:

.rules.yml: Define a Prometheus alert for failed backups
[source,yaml]
----
rules.yml: |
  groups:     
    - name: fail-backup
        rules:
          - alert: BackupFailed
            expr: kube_customresource_backup_info{status="Error"}
            for: 5s
            labels:
              severity: critical
            annotations:
              summary: "Backup Failed"
              description: "A Backup has failed."
