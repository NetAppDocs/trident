Learn more about the ports that Trident uses for communication. 

== Trident ports

Trident uses the following ports for communication inside Kubernetes:

[cols="2,4" options="header"]
|===
|Port |Purpose
|8443 |Backchannel HTTPS
|8001 |Prometheus metrics endpoint
|8000 |Trident REST server
|17546 |Liveness/readiness probe port used by Trident daemonset pods
|===

[NOTE] 
The liveness/readiness probe port can be changed during installation using the `--probe-port` flag. It is important to make sure this port isn't being used by another process on the worker nodes.

- **Outbound focus**: Kubernetes nodes (controller and worker) primarily initiate traffic to storage LIFs/IPs, so iptables rules should allow outbound from node IPs to specific storage IPs on these ports. Avoid broad "any-to-any" rules.
- **Inbound restrictions**: Limit internal Trident ports to cluster-internal traffic (e.g., via CNI like Calico). No unnecessary inbound exposure on host firewalls.
- **Protocol security**: Use TCP where possible (more reliable); enable CHAP/IPsec for iSCSI if sensitive; TLS/HTTPS for management (port 443/8443). For NFSv4 (default in Trident), prune UDP/older NFSv3 ports (e.g., 4045-4049) if not needed. Restrict to trusted subnets; monitor with tools like Prometheus (optional port 8001).


Ports for Controller Nodes
Primarily for Trident operator (backend management). All internal ports are pod-level; allow on nodes only if host firewall interferes with CNI.

| Port/Protocol | Direction | Purpose | Driver/Protocol | Security Notes

| TCP 8000
| Inbound/Outbound (cluster-internal)
| Trident REST server (operator-controller comms)
| All
| Restrict to pod CIDRs; no external exposure.

| TCP 8443
| Inbound/Outbound (cluster-internal)
| Backchannel HTTPS (secure internal API)
| All
| TLS-encrypted; limit to Kubernetes service mesh if used.

| TCP 8001
| Inbound (cluster-internal, optional)
| Prometheus metrics
| All
| Expose only to monitoring tools (e.g., via RBAC); disable if unused.

| TCP 443
| Outbound
| HTTPS to ONTAP SVM/cluster mgmt LIF
| ONTAP (all), ANF
| Require TLS cert validation; restrict to mgmt LIF IPs only.

| TCP 8443
| Outbound
| HTTPS to E-Series Web Services Proxy
| E-Series (iSCSI)
| Default REST API; use certs; configurable in backend YAML.

Updated Ports for Worker Nodes
For CSI node daemonsets and pod mounts. Data ports are outbound to storage data LIFs; include NFSv3 extras if using v3 (optional for v4).


[cols="1,1,2,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Port/Protocol | Direction | Purpose | Driver/Protocol | Security Notes

| TCP 17546
| Inbound (local to pod)
| CSI node liveness/readiness probes
| All
| Configurable (--probe-port); ensure no host conflicts; local-only.

| TCP 8000
| Inbound/Outbound (cluster-internal)
| Trident REST server
| All
| As above; pod-internal.

| TCP 8443
| Inbound/Outbound (cluster-internal)
| Backchannel HTTPS
| All
| As above.

| TCP 8001
| Inbound (cluster-internal, optional)
| Prometheus metrics
| All
| As above.

| TCP 443
| Outbound
| HTTPS to ONTAP SVM/cluster mgmt LIF
| ONTAP (all), ANF
| As above; used for discovery.

| TCP 8443
| Outbound
| HTTPS to E-Series Web Services Proxy
| E-Series (iSCSI)
| As above.

| TCP/UDP 111
| Outbound
| RPCBIND/portmapper
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3/v4), ANF (NFS)
| Required for v3; optional for v4 (firewall offload); restrict if using NFSv4-only.

| TCP/UDP 2049
| Outbound
| NFS daemon
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3/v4), ANF (NFS)
| Core data; well-known; use TCP for reliability.

| TCP/UDP 635
| Outbound
| Mount daemon
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3/v4), ANF (NFS)
| Mounting; bidirectional callbacks possible (allow inbound ephemeral if needed).

| UDP 4045
| Outbound
| NFS lock manager (nlockmgr)
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3)
| File locking; skip for v4 (pNFS handles); UDP-only.

| UDP 4046
| Outbound
| NFS status monitor (statd)
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3)
| Notifications; may need inbound ephemeral ports (1024-65535) for callbacks.

| UDP 4049
| Outbound
| NFS quota daemon (rquotad)
| ONTAP-NAS (NFSv3)
| Quotas; skip for v4.

| TCP 3260
| Outbound
| iSCSI target (discovery/data/CHAP)
| ONTAP-SAN (iSCSI), E-Series (iSCSI)
| Well-known; CHAP auth over this port; enable mutual CHAP for security.

| TCP 445
| Outbound
| SMB/CIFS
| ONTAP-NAS (SMB), ANF (SMB)
| Well-known; use SMB3 with encryption (Trident annotation netapp.io/smb-encryption=true).

| TCP/UDP 88 (optional)
| Outbound
| Kerberos auth
| ONTAP (NFS/SMB/iSCSI with Kerb)
| If using Kerberos (not default); to AD servers, not storage.

| TCP/UDP 389 (optional)
| Outbound
| LDAP
| ONTAP (NFS/SMB with LDAP)
| Similar; for name resolution/auth; restrict to AD.
