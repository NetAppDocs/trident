Astra Trident runs as a single Controller Pod plus a Node Pod on each worker node in the cluster. The node pod must be running on any host where you want to potentially mount an Astra Trident volume. 

== Understanding controller pods and node pods
Astra Trident deploys as a single <<Trident Controller Pod>> and one or more <<Trident Node Pods>> on the Kubernetes cluster and uses standard Kubernetes _CSI Sidecar Containers_ to simplify the deployment of CSI plugins. link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/sidecar-containers.html[Kubernetes CSI Sidecar Containers^] are maintained by the Kubernetes Storage community. 

Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[node selectors^] and link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[tolerations and taints^] are used to constrain a pod to run on a specific or preferred node. You can configure node selectors and tolerations for controller and node pods during Astra Trident installation.

* The controller plugin handles volume provisioning and management, such as snapshots and resizing. 
* The node plugin handles attaching the storage to the node.

=== Trident Controller Pod
The Trident Controller Pod is a single Pod running the CSI Controller plugin. 

* Responsible for provisioning and managing volumes in NetApp storage
* Managed by a Kubernetes Deployment 
* Can run on the control-plane or worker nodes, depending on installation parameters.

=== Trident Node Pods
Trident Node Pods are privileged Pods running the CSI Node plugin. 

* Responsible for mounting and unmounting storage for Pods running on the host
* Managed by a Kubernetes DaemonSet
* Must run on any node that will mount NetApp storage
