summary: If you are just getting started with Kubernetes, use the instructions to install Kubernetes to try it out. These instructions provide a bare-bones, single-node cluster that Trident can integrate with for demonstration purposes.

[.lead]
You can install Astra Trident and get start managing storage resources in a few steps. Before getting started, review link:requirements.html[Astra Trident requirements].

NOTE: For Docker, refer to link:../trident-docker/deploy-docker.html[Astra Trident for Docker].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Astra Trident offers several installation methods and modes optimized for a variety of environments and organizations.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Prepare the worker node
[role="quick-margin-para"]
All worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must be able to mount the volumes you have provisioned for your pods.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Create a backend
[role="quick-margin-para"]
A backend defines the relationship between Astra Trident and a storage system. It tells Astra Trident how to communicate with that storage system and how Astra Trident should provision volumes from it.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Create a Kubernetes StorageClass
[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Kubernetes StorageClass object specifies Astra Trident as the provisioner and allows you to create a storage class to provision volumes with customizable attributes. Astra Trident creates a matching storage class for Kubernetes objects that specify the Astra Trident provisioner.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Provision a volume 
[role="quick-margin-para"]
A _PersistentVolume_ (PV) is a physical storage resource provisioned by the cluster administrator on a Kubernetes cluster. The _PersistentVolumeClaim_ (PVC) is a request for access to the PersistentVolume on the cluster. 

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a PersistentVolume (PV) and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that uses the configured Kubernetes StorageClass to request access to the PV. You can then mount the PV to a pod.

== What's next?
You can now add additional backends, manage storage classes, manage backends, and perform volume operations.
