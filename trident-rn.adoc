Release Notes provide information about new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in the latest version of Astra Trident.

WARNING: The `tridentctl` binary for Linux that is provided in the installer zip file is the tested and supported version. Be aware that the `macos` binary provided in the `/extras` part of the zip file is not tested or supported.

== What's new in 22.10
*You must read the following critical information before upgrading to Astra Trident 22.10.*

[WARNING]
.*Critical information about Astra Trident 22.10*
====
* Kubernetes 1.25 is now supported in Trident. You must upgrade Astra Trident to 22.10 prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.25.
* Astra Trident now strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of `find_multipaths: no` in multipath.conf file. 
+
Use of non-multipathing configuration or use of `find_multipaths: yes` or `find_multipaths: smart` value in multipath.conf file will result in mount failures. Trident has recommended the use of `find_multipaths: no` since the 21.07 release.
====

=== Fixes

* Fixed issue specific to ONTAP backend created using `credentials` field failing to come online during 22.07.0 upgrade (link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/759[Issue #759^]). 
* **Docker:** Fixed an issue causing the Docker volume plugin to fail to start in some environments (link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/548[Issue #548^] and link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/760[Issue #760^]).
* Fixed SLM issue specific to ONTAP SAN backends to ensure only subset of data LIFs belonging to reporting nodes are published.
* Fixed performance issue where unnecessary scans for iSCSI LUNs happened when attaching a volume.
* Removed granular retries within the Astra Trident iSCSI workflow to fail fast and reduce external retry intervals.
* Fixed issue where an error was returned when flushing an iSCSI device when the corresponding multipath device was already flushed.

=== Enhancements

* Kubernetes:
** Added support for Kubernetes 1.25. You must upgrade Astra Trident to 22.10 prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.25.
** Added a separate ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding for the Trident Deployment and DaemonSet to allow future permissions enhancements.
** Added support for link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/volume-share.html[cross-namespace volume sharing].

* All Trident `ontap-*` storage drivers now work with the ONTAP REST API.

* Added new operator yaml (`bundle_post_1_25.yaml`) without a `PodSecurityPolicy` to support Kubernetes 1.25.

* Added link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-reco/security-reco.html#enable-per-volume-host-side-encryption-using-linux-unified-key-setup-luks[support for LUKS-encrypted volumes] for `ontap-san` and `ontap-san-economy` storage drivers.

* Added support for Windows Server 2019 nodes.

* Added link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/anf.html[support for SMB volumes on Windows nodes] through the `azure-netapp-files` storage driver.

=== Deprecations

* **Kubernetes:** Updated minimum supported Kubernetes to 1.20.
* Removed Astra Data Store (ADS) driver.
* Removed support for `yes` and `smart` options for `find_multipaths` when configuring worker node multipathing for iSCSI.

== Changes in 22.07

=== Fixes

**Kubernetes**

* Fixed issue to handle boolean and number values for node selector when configuring Trident with Helm or the Trident Operator. (link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/700[GitHub issue #700^])

* Fixed issue in handling errors from non-CHAP path, so that kubelet will retry if it fails. link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/736[GitHub issue #736^])


=== Enhancements

* Transition from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io as default registry for CSI images

* ONTAP-SAN volumes will now use per-node igroups and only map LUNs to igroups while actively published to those nodes to improve our security posture. Existing volumes will be opportunistically switched to the new igroup scheme when Trident determines it is safe to do so without impacting active workloads.

* Included a ResourceQuota with Trident installations to ensure Trident DaemonSet is scheduled when PriorityClass consumption is limited by default.

* **Kubernetes:** Updated minimum supported Kubernetes to 1.19.

* Backend config no longer allows multiple authentication types in single config.

=== Removals 

* AWS CVS driver (deprecated since 22.04) has been removed.

* Kubernetes 

** Removed unnecessary SYS_ADMIN capability from node pods.

** Reduces nodeprep down to simple host info and active service discovery to do a best-effort
confirmation that NFS/iSCSI services are available on worker nodes.

=== Experimental enhancements

* Added support for volume replication in the `ontap-san` driver.
* Added *tech preview* REST support for the `ontap-nas-flexgroup`, `ontap-san`, and `ontap-nas-economy` drivers.

== Known issues

Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using the product successfully.

* Astra Trident now enforces a blank `fsType` (`fsType=""`) for volumes that do not have the `fsType` specified in their StorageClass. When working with Kubernetes 1.17 or later, Trident supports providing a blank `fsType` for NFS volumes. For iSCSI volumes, you are required to set the `fsType` on your StorageClass when enforcing an `fsGroup` using a Security Context.

* When using a backend across multiple Astra Trident instances, each backend configuration file should have a different `storagePrefix` value for ONTAP backends or use a different `TenantName` for SolidFire backends. Astra Trident cannot detect volumes that other instances of Astra Trident have created. Attempting to create an existing volume on either ONTAP or SolidFire backends succeeds, because Astra Trident treats volume creation as an idempotent operation. If `storagePrefix` or `TenantName` do not differ, there might be name collisions for volumes created on the same backend.

* When installing Astra Trident (using `tridentctl` or the Trident Operator) and using `tridentctl` to manage Astra Trident, you should ensure the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set. This is necessary to indicate the Kubernetes cluster that `tridentctl` should work against. When working with multiple Kubernetes environments, you should ensure that the `KUBECONFIG` file is sourced accurately.

* To perform online space reclamation for iSCSI PVs, the underlying OS on the worker node might require mount options to be passed to the volume. This is true for RHEL/RedHat CoreOS instances, which require the `discard` https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/discarding-unused-blocks_managing-file-systems[mount option^]; ensure that the discard mountOption is included in your https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[`StorageClass`^] to support online block discard.

* If you have more than one instance of Astra Trident per Kubernetes cluster, Astra Trident cannot communicate with other instances and cannot discover other volumes that they have created, which leads to unexpected and incorrect behavior if more than one instance runs within a cluster. There should be only one instance of Astra Trident per Kubernetes cluster.

* If Astra Trident-based `StorageClass` objects are deleted from Kubernetes while Astra Trident is offline, Astra Trident does not remove the corresponding storage classes from its database when it comes back online. You should delete these storage classes using `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* If a user deletes a PV provisioned by Astra Trident before deleting the corresponding PVC, Astra Trident does not automatically delete the backing volume. You should remove the volume via `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* ONTAP cannot concurrently provision more than one FlexGroup at a time unless the set of aggregates are unique to each provisioning request.

* When using Astra Trident over IPv6, you should specify `managementLIF` and `dataLIF` in the backend definition within square brackets. For example, ``[fd20:8b1e:b258:2000:f816:3eff:feec:0]``.

* If using the `solidfire-san` driver with OpenShift 4.5, ensure that the underlying worker nodes use MD5 as the CHAP authentication algorithm. Secure FIPS-compliant CHAP algorithms SHA1, SHA-256, and SHA3-256 are available with Element 12.7.
