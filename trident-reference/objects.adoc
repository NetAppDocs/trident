:hardbreaks:

You can interact with Kubernetes and Trident using REST APIs by reading and writing resource objects. There are several resource objects that dictate the relationship between Kubernetes and Trident, Trident and storage, and Kubernetes and storage. Some of these objects are managed through Kubernetes and the others are managed through Trident.

== How do the objects interact with one another?

Perhaps the easiest way to understand the objects, what they are for, and how they interact, is to follow a single request for storage from a Kubernetes user:

. A user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` requesting a new `PersistentVolume` of a particular size from a Kubernetes `StorageClass` that was previously configured by the administrator.
. The Kubernetes `StorageClass` identifies Trident as its provisioner and includes parameters that tell Trident how to provision a volume for the requested class.
. Trident looks at its own `StorageClass` with the same name that identifies the matching `Backends` and `StoragePools` that it can use to provision volumes for the class.
. Trident provisions storage on a matching backend and creates two objects: a `PersistentVolume` in Kubernetes that tells Kubernetes how to find, mount, and treat the volume, and a volume in Trident that retains the relationship between the `PersistentVolume` and the actual storage.
. Kubernetes binds the `PersistentVolumeClaim` to the new `PersistentVolume`. Pods that include the `PersistentVolumeClaim` mount that PersistentVolume on any host that it runs on.
. A user creates a `VolumeSnapshot` of an existing PVC, using a `VolumeSnapshotClass` that points to Trident.
. Trident identifies the volume that is associated with the PVC and creates a snapshot of the volume on its backend. It also creates a `VolumeSnapshotContent` that instructs Kubernetes on how to identify the snapshot.
. A user can create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` using `VolumeSnapshot` as the source.
. Trident identifies the required snapshot and performs the same set of steps involved in creating a `PersistentVolume` and a `Volume`.

TIP: For further reading about Kubernetes objects, we highly recommend that you read the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Persistent Volumes^] section of the Kubernetes documentation.

== Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects

A Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` object is a request for storage made by a Kubernetes cluster user.

In addition to the standard specification, Trident allows users to specify the following volume-specific annotations if they want to override the defaults that you set in the backend configuration:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Annotation |Volume Option |Supported Drivers
|trident.netapp.io/fileSystem |fileSystem |ontap-san, solidfire-san,
eseries-iscsi, ontap-san-economy

|trident.netapp.io/cloneFromPVC |cloneSourceVolume |ontap-nas,
ontap-san, solidfire-san, azure-netapp-files, gcp-cvs,
ontap-san-economy

|trident.netapp.io/splitOnClone |splitOnClone |ontap-nas, ontap-san

|trident.netapp.io/protocol |protocol |any

|trident.netapp.io/exportPolicy |exportPolicy |ontap-nas,
ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup

|trident.netapp.io/snapshotPolicy |snapshotPolicy |ontap-nas,
ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup, ontap-san

|trident.netapp.io/snapshotReserve |snapshotReserve |ontap-nas,
ontap-nas-flexgroup, ontap-san, gcp-cvs

|trident.netapp.io/snapshotDirectory |snapshotDirectory |ontap-nas,
ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup

|trident.netapp.io/unixPermissions |unixPermissions |ontap-nas,
ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup

|trident.netapp.io/blockSize |blockSize |solidfire-san
|===

If the created PV has the `Delete` reclaim policy, Trident deletes both the PV and the backing volume when the PV becomes released (that is, when the user deletes the PVC). Should the delete action fail, Trident marks the PV as such and periodically retries the operation until it succeeds or the PV is manually deleted. If the PV uses the `+Retain+` policy, Trident ignores it and assumes the administrator will clean it up from Kubernetes and the backend, allowing the volume to be backed up or inspected before its removal. Note that deleting the PV does not cause Trident to delete the backing volume. You should remove it using the REST API (`tridentctl`).

Trident supports the creation of Volume Snapshots using the CSI specification: you can create a Volume Snapshot and use it as a Data Source to clone existing PVCs. This way, point-in-time copies of PVs can be exposed to Kubernetes in the form of snapshots. The snapshots can then be used to create new PVs. Take a look at `+On-Demand Volume Snapshots+` to see how this would work.

Trident also provides the `cloneFromPVC` and `splitOnClone` annotations for creating clones. You can use these  annotations to clone a PVC without having to use the CSI implementation (on Kubernetes 1.13 and earlier) or if your Kubernetes release does not support beta Volume Snapshots (Kubernetes 1.16 and earlier). Keep in mind that Trident 19.10 supports the CSI workflow for cloning from a PVC.

NOTE: You can use the `cloneFromPVC` and `splitOnClone` annotations with CSI Trident as well as the traditional non-CSI frontend.

Here is an example: If a user already has a PVC called `mysql`, the user can create a new PVC called `mysqlclone` by using the annotation, such as `trident.netapp.io/cloneFromPVC: mysql`. With this annotation set, Trident clones the volume corresponding to the mysql PVC, instead of provisioning a volume from scratch.

Consider the following points:

* We recommend cloning an idle volume.
* A PVC and its clone should be in the same Kubernetes namespace and have the same storage class.
* With the `ontap-nas` and `ontap-san` drivers, it might be desirable to set the PVC annotation `trident.netapp.io/splitOnClone` in conjunction with `trident.netapp.io/cloneFromPVC`. With `trident.netapp.io/splitOnClone` set to `true`, Trident splits the cloned volume from the parent volume and thus, completely decoupling the life cycle of the cloned volume from its parent at the expense of losing some storage efficiency. Not setting `trident.netapp.io/splitOnClone` or setting it to `false` results in reduced space consumption on the backend at the expense of creating dependencies between the parent and clone volumes such that the parent volume cannot be deleted unless the clone is deleted first. A scenario where splitting the clone makes sense is cloning an empty database volume where it's expected for the volume and its clone to greatly diverge and not benefit from storage efficiencies offered by ONTAP.

The `sample-input` directory contains examples of PVC definitions for use with Trident. See Trident Volume objects for a full description of the parameters and settings associated with Trident volumes.

== Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` objects

A Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` object represents a piece of storage that is made available to the Kubernetes cluster. It has a lifecycle that is independent of the pod that uses it.

NOTE: Trident creates `PersistentVolume` objects and registers them with the Kubernetes cluster automatically based on the volumes that it provisions. You are not expected to manage them yourself.

When you create a PVC that refers to a Trident-based `StorageClass`, Trident provisions a new volume using the corresponding storage class and registers a new PV for that volume. In configuring the provisioned volume and corresponding PV, Trident follows the following rules:

* Trident generates a PV name for Kubernetes and an internal name that it uses to provision the storage. In both cases, it is assuring that the names are unique in their scope.
* The size of the volume matches the requested size in the PVC as closely as possible, though it might be rounded up to the nearest allocatable quantity, depending on the platform.

== Kubernetes `StorageClass` objects

Kubernetes `StorageClass` objects are specified by name in `PersistentVolumeClaims` to provision storage with a set of properties. The storage class itself identifies the provisioner to be used and defines that set of properties in terms the provisioner understands.

It is one of two basic objects that need to be created and managed by the administrator. The other is the Trident backend object.

A Kubernetes `StorageClass` object that uses Trident looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: <Name>
provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io
mountOptions: <Mount Options>
parameters:
  <Trident Parameters>
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
----

These parameters are Trident-specific and tell Trident how to provision volumes for the class.

The storage class parameters are:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Required |Description
|attributes |map[string]string |no |See the attributes section below

|storagePools |map[string]StringList |no |Map of backend names to lists

|additionalStoragePools |map[string]StringList |no |Map of backend names
to lists of storage pools within

|excludeStoragePools |map[string]StringList |no |Map of backend names to
lists of storage pools within
|===

Storage attributes and their possible values can be classified into storage pool selection attributes and Kubernetes attributes.

=== Storage pool selection attributes

These parameters determine which Trident-managed storage pools should be utilized to provision volumes of a given type.

[cols=",,,,,",options="header",]
|===

|IOPS |int |positive integer |Pool is capable of guaranteeing IOPS in this range |Volume guaranteed these IOPS |solidfire-san
|===

^1^: Not supported by ONTAP Select systems

In most cases, the values requested directly influence provisioning; for instance, requesting thick provisioning results in a thickly provisioned volume. However, an Element storage pool uses its offered IOPS minimum and maximum to set QoS values, rather than the requested value. In this case, the requested value is used only to select the storage pool.

Ideally, you can use `attributes` alone to model the qualities of the storage you need to satisfy the needs of a particular class. Trident automatically discovers and selects storage pools that match _all_ of the `attributes` that you specify.

If you find yourself unable to use `attributes` to automatically select the right pools for a class, you can use the `storagePools` and `additionalStoragePools` parameters to further refine the pools or even to select a specific set of pools.

You can use the `storagePools` parameter to further restrict the set of pools that match any specified `attributes`. In other words, Trident uses the intersection of pools identified by the `attributes` and `storagePools` parameters for provisioning. You can use either parameter alone or both together.

You can use the `additionalStoragePools` parameter to extend the set of pools that Trident uses for provisioning, regardless of any pools selected by the `attributes` and `storagePools` parameters.

You can use the `excludeStoragePools` parameter to filter the set of pools that Trident uses for provisioning. Using this parameter removes any pools that match.

In the `storagePools` and `additionalStoragePools` parameters, each entry takes the form `<backend>:<storagePoolList>`, where `<storagePoolList>` is a comma-separated list of storage pools for the specified backend. For example, a value for `additionalStoragePools` might look like `ontapnas_192.168.1.100:aggr1,aggr2;solidfire_192.168.1.101:bronze`.
These lists accept regex values for both the backend and list values. You can use `tridentctl get backend` to get the list of backends and their pools.

=== Kubernetes attributes

These attributes have no impact on the selection of storage pools/backends by Trident during dynamic provisioning. Instead, these attributes simply supply parameters supported by Kubernetes Persistent Volumes. Worker nodes are responsible for filesystem create operations and might require filesystem utilities, such as xfsprogs.

[cols=",,,,,",options="header",]

|Attribute |Type |Values |Description |Relevant Drivers |Kubernetes
Version
|fsType |string |ext4, ext3, xfs, etc. |The file system type for block
volumes |solidfire-san, ontap-nas, ontap-nas-economy, ontap-nas-flexgroup, ontap-san, ontap-san-economy, eseries-iscsi |All

|volumeBindingMode |string |Immediate, WaitForFirstConsumer |Choose when volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs |All |1.17+
|===

[TIP]
====
* The `fsType` parameter is used to control the desired file system type for SAN LUNs. In addition, Kubernetes also uses the presence of `fsType` in a storage class to indicate a filesystem exists. Volume ownership can be controlled using the `fsGroup` security context of a pod only if `fsType` is set. See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[Kubernetes: Configure a Security Context for a Pod or Container^] for an overview on setting volume ownership using the `fsGroup` context. Kubernetes will apply the `fsGroup` value only if:

** `fsType` is set in the storage class.
** The PVC access mode is RWO.

+
For NFS storage drivers, a filesystem already exists as part of the NFS export. In order to use `fsGroup` the storage class still needs to specify a `fsType`. You can set it to `nfs` or any non-null value.

* See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-expansion.html[Expand volumes^] for further details on volume expansion.

* The Trident installer bundle provides several example storage class definitions for use with Trident in ``sample-input/storage-class-*.yaml``. Deleting a Kubernetes storage class causes the corresponding Trident storage class to be deleted as well.

== Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshotClass` objects

Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshotClass` objects are analogous to `StorageClasses`. They help define multiple classes of storage and are referenced by volume snapshots to associate the snapshot with the required snapshot class. Each volume snapshot is associated with a single volume snapshot class.

A `VolumeSnapshotClass` should be defined by an administrator in order to create snapshots. A volume snapshot class is created with the following definition:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-snapclass
driver: csi.trident.netapp.io
deletionPolicy: Delete
----

The `driver` specifies to Kubernetes that requests for volume snapshots of the `csi-snapclass` class are handled by Trident. The `deletionPolicy` specifies the action to be taken when a snapshot must be deleted. When `deletionPolicy` is set to `Delete`, the volume snapshot objects as well as the underlying snapshot on the storage cluster are removed when a snapshot is deleted. Alternatively, setting it to `Retain` means that `VolumeSnapshotContent` and the physical snapshot are retained.

== Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot` objects

A Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot` object is a request to create a snapshot of a volume. Just as a PVC represents a request made by a user for a volume, a volume snapshot is a request made by a user to create a snapshot of an existing PVC.

When a volume snapshot request comes in, Trident automatically manages the creation of the snapshot for the volume on the backend and exposes the snapshot by creating a unique
`VolumeSnapshotContent` object. You can create snapshots from existing PVCs and use the snapshots as a DataSource when creating new PVCs.

NOTE: The lifecyle of a VolumeSnapshot is independent of the source PVC: a snapshot persists even after the source PVC is deleted. When deleting a PVC which has associated snapshots, Trident marks the backing volume for this PVC in a *Deleting* state, but does not remove it completely. The volume is removed when all the associated snapshots are deleted.

== Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshotContent` objects

A Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshotContent` object represents a snapshot taken from an already provisioned volume. It is analogous to a `PersistentVolume` and signifies a provisioned snapshot on the storage cluster. Similar to `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `PersistentVolume` objects, when a snapshot is created, the `VolumeSnapshotContent` object maintains a one-to-one mapping to the `VolumeSnapshot` object, which had requested the snapshot creation.

NOTE: Trident creates `VolumeSnapshotContent` objects and registers them with the Kubernetes cluster automatically based on the volumes that it provisions. You are not expected to manage them yourself.

The `VolumeSnapshotContent` object contains details that uniquely identify the snapshot, such as the `snapshotHandle`. This `snapshotHandle` is a unique combination of the name of the PV and the name of the `VolumeSnapshotContent` object.

When a snapshot request comes in, Trident creates the snapshot on the backend. After the snapshot is created, Trident configures a `VolumeSnapshotContent` object and thus exposes the snapshot to the Kubernetes API.

== Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` objects

Kubernetes Custom Resources are endpoints in the Kubernetes API that are defined by the administrator and are used to group similar objects. Kubernetes supports the creation of custom resources for storing a collection of objects. You can obtain these resource definitions by running `kubectl get crds`.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and their associated object metadata are stored by Kubernetes in its metadata store. This eliminates the need for a separate store for Trident.

Beginning with the 19.07 release, Trident uses a number of `CustomResourceDefinition` objects to preserve the identity of Trident objects, such as Trident backends, Trident storage classes, and Trident volumes. These objects are managed by Trident. In addition, the CSI volume snapshot framework introduces some CRDs that are required to define volume snapshots.

CRDs are a Kubernetes construct. Objects of the resources defined above are created by Trident. As a simple example, when a backend is created using `tridentctl`, a corresponding `tridentbackends` CRD object is created for consumption by Kubernetes.

Here are a few points to keep in mind about Trident's CRDs:

* When Trident is installed, a set of CRDs are created and can be used like any other resource type.
* When upgrading from a previous version of Trident (one that used `etcd` to maintain state), the Trident installer migrates data from the `etcd` key-value data store and creates corresponding CRD objects.
* When uninstalling Trident by using the `tridentctl uninstall` command, Trident pods are deleted but the created CRDs are not cleaned up. See link:../trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html[Uninstall Trident^] to understand how Trident can be completely removed and reconfigured from scratch.

== Trident `StorageClass` objects

Trident creates matching storage classes for Kubernetes `StorageClass` objects that specify `csi.trident.netapp.io`/`netapp.io/trident` in their provisioner field. The storage class name matches that of the Kubernetes `StorageClass` object it represents.

NOTE: With Kubernetes, these objects are created automatically when a Kubernetes `StorageClass` that uses Trident as a provisioner is registered.

Storage classes comprise a set of requirements for volumes. Trident matches these requirements with the attributes present in each storage pool; if they match, that storage pool is a valid target for provisioning volumes using that storage class.

You can create storage class configurations to directly define storage classes by using the REST API. However, for Kubernetes deployments, we expect them to be created when registering new Kubernetes `StorageClass` objects.

== Trident backend objects

Backends represent the storage providers on top of which Trident provisions volumes; a single Trident instance can manage any number of backends.

NOTE: This is one of the two object types that you create and manage yourself. The other is the Kubernetes `StorageClass` object.

For more information about how to construct these objects, see Backend configuration.

== Trident `StoragePool` objects

Storage pools represent the distinct locations available for provisioning on each backend. For ONTAP, these correspond to aggregates in SVMs. For NetApp HCI/SolidFire, these correspond to administrator-specified QoS bands. For Cloud Volumes Service, these correspond to cloud provider regions. Each storage pool has a set of distinct storage attributes, which define its performance characteristics and data protection characteristics.

Unlike the other objects here, storage pool candidates are always discovered and managed automatically.

== Trident `Volume` objects

Volumes are the basic unit of provisioning, comprising backend endpoints, such as NFS shares and iSCSI LUNs. In Kubernetes, these correspond directly to `PersistentVolumes`. When you create a volume, ensure that it has a storage class, which determines where that volume can be provisioned, along with a size.

NOTE: In Kubernetes, these objects are managed automatically. You can view them to see what Trident provisioned.

TIP: When deleting a PV with associated snapshots, the corresponding Trident volume is updated to a *Deleting* state. For the Trident volume to be deleted, you should remove the snapshots of the volume.

A volume configuration defines the properties that a provisioned volume should have.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Required |Description
|version |string |no |Version of the Trident API ("1")

|name |string |yes |Name of volume to create

|storageClass |string |yes |Storage class to use when provisioning the volume

|size |string |yes |Size of the volume to provision in bytes

|protocol |string |no |Protocol type to use; "file" or "block"

|internalName |string |no |Name of the object on the storage system; generated by Trident

|cloneSourceVolume |string |no |ontap (nas, san) & solidfire-*: Name of the volume to clone from

|splitOnClone |string |no |ontap (nas, san): Split the clone from its parent

|snapshotPolicy |string |no |ontap-*: Snapshot policy to use

|snapshotReserve |string |no |ontap-*: Percentage of volume reserved for snapshots

|exportPolicy |string |no |ontap-nas*: Export policy to use

|snapshotDirectory |bool |no |ontap-nas*: Whether the snapshot directory is visible

|unixPermissions |string |no |ontap-nas*: Initial UNIX permissions

|blockSize |string |no |solidfire-*: Block/sector size

|fileSystem |string |no |File system type

|===


Trident generates `internalName` when creating the volume. This consists of two steps. First, it prepends the storage prefix (either the default `trident` or the prefix in the backend configuration) to the volume name, resulting in a name of the form `<prefix>-<volume-name>`. It then proceeds to sanitize the name, replacing characters not permitted in the backend. For ONTAP backends, it replaces hyphens with underscores (thus, the internal name becomes `<prefix>_<volume-name>`). For Element backends, it replaces underscores with hyphens. 

You can use volume configurations to directly provision volumes using the REST API, but in Kubernetes deployments we expect most users to use the standard Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` method. Trident creates this volume object automatically as part of the provisioning
process.

== Trident `Snapshot` objects

Snapshots are a point-in-time copy of volumes, which can be used to provision new volumes or restore state. In Kubernetes, these correspond directly to `VolumeSnapshotContent` objects. Each snapshot is associated with a volume, which is the source of the data for the snapshot.

Each `Snapshot` object includes the properties listed below:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Required |Description
|version |String a|
Yes
|Version of the Trident API ("1")
|name |String a|
Yes
|Name of the Trident snapshot object
|internalName |String a|
Yes
|Name of the Trident snapshot object on the storage system
|volumeName |String a|
Yes
|Name of the Persistent Volume for which the snapshot is created
|volumeInternalName |String a|
Yes
|Name of the associated Trident volume object on the storage system
|===

NOTE: In Kubernetes, these objects are managed automatically. You can view them to see what Trident provisioned.

When a Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot` object request is created, Trident works by creating a snapshot object on the backing storage system. The `internalName` of this snapshot object is generated by combining the prefix `snapshot-` with the `UID` of the `VolumeSnapshot` object (for example, `snapshot-e8d8a0ca-9826-11e9-9807-525400f3f660`). `volumeName` and `volumeInternalName` are populated by getting the details of the backing
volume.
