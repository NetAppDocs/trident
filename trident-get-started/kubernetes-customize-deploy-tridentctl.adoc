= Customize `tridentctl` deployment

Trident installer enables you to customize attributes. For example, if you have copied the Trident image to a private repository, you can specify the image name by using `--trident-image`. If you have copied the Trident image as well as the needed CSI sidecar images to a private repository, it might be preferable to specify the location of that repository by using the `--image-registry` switch, which takes the form `<registry FQDN>[:port]`.

To have Astra Trident automatically configure worker nodes for you, use `--enable-node-prep`. For more details on how it works, see link:../trident-use/automatic-workernode.html[here^].

NOTE: Automatic worker node preparation is a *beta feature* meant to be used in non-production environments only.

If you are using a distribution of Kubernetes, where `kubelet` keeps its data on a path other than the usual `/var/lib/kubelet`, you can specify the alternate path by using `--kubelet-dir`.

If you need to customize the installation beyond what the installer's arguments allow, you can also customize the deployment files. Using the `--generate-custom-yaml` parameter creates the following YAML files in the installer's `setup` directory:

* `trident-clusterrolebinding.yaml`
* `trident-deployment.yaml`
* `trident-crds.yaml`
* `trident-clusterrole.yaml`
* `trident-daemonset.yaml`
* `trident-service.yaml`
* `trident-namespace.yaml`
* `trident-serviceaccount.yaml`

After you have generated these files, you can modify them according to your needs and then use `--use-custom-yaml` to install your custom deployment.
