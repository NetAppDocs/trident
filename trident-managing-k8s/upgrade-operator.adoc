You can easily upgrade an existing Trident installation by using the operator.

.What you'll need

To upgrade by using the Trident operator, the following conditions should be met:

* You should have a CSI-based Trident installation. To check if you are running CSI Trident, examine the pods in your Trident namespace. If they follow the `trident-csi-*` naming pattenr, you are running CSI Trident.
* You should have a CRD-based Trident installation. This represents all Trident releases from 19.07 and later. If you have a CSI-based installation, you most likely have a CRD-based installation.
* If you have uninstalled CSI Trident and the metadata from the installation persists, you can upgrade by using the operator.
* Only one Trident installation should exist across all the namespaces in a given Kubernetes cluster.
* You should be using a Kubernetes cluster that runs version 1.14 and later.
* If alpha snapshot CRDs are present, you should remove them with `tridentctl obliviate alpha-snapshot-crd`. This deletes the CRDs for the alpha snapshot spec. For existing snapshots that should be deleted/migrated, see https://netapp.io/2020/01/30/alpha-to-beta-snapshots/[this blog^].

WARNING: When upgrading Trident by using the operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you should upgrade to Trident 21.01.1 or later. The Trident operator released with 21.01.0 contains a known issue that has been fixed in 21.01.1. For more details, see the https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/517[issue details on GitHub^].

== Upgrade by using the cluster-scoped operator

Starting with Trident 21.01, the operator is cluster scoped as opposed to namespace scoped. You can upgrade from Trident installed by using the namespace-scoped operator (versions 20.04 through 20.10) to a newer version that makes use of the cluster-scoped operator (versions 21.01 and later).

.Steps
. Verify the status of the existing Trident installation. To do this, check the *Status* of  `TridentProvisioner`. The status should be `Installed`.
+
----
#Check the status of TridentProvisioner
$ kubectl describe tprov trident -n trident | grep Message: -A 3
Message:  Trident installed
Status:   Installed
Version:  v20.10.1
----
+
NOTE:  If the status shows `Updating`, ensure that you resolve it before proceeding. For a list of possible status values, see link:../trident-kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[here^].

. Create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD by using the manifest provided with the Trident installer.
+
----
# Download the release required [21.01]
$ mkdir 21.04.0
$ cd 21.04.0
$ wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v21.04.0/trident-installer-21.04.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xf trident-installer-21.04.0.tar.gz
$ cd trident-installer

# Is your Kubernetes version < 1.16?
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_pre1.16.yaml

# If not, your Kubernetes version must be 1.16 and above
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
----
. Delete the namespace-scoped operator by using its manifest. To complete this step, you require the `bundle.yaml` file used to deploy the namespace-scoped operator. You can obtain `bundle.yaml` from the Trident repository. Make sure to use the appropriate branch.
+
NOTE: You should make the necessary changes to the Trident install parameters (for example, changing the values for `tridentImage`, `autosupportImage`, private image repository, and providing `imagePullSecrets`) after deleting the namespace-scoped operator and before installing the cluster-scoped operator. For a complete list of parameters that can be updated, see the link:../trident-deploy-k8s/kubernetes-customize-deploy.html[list of parameters^].

----
#Ensure you are in the right directory

$ /root/20.10.1/trident-installer

#Delete the namespace-scoped operator
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/bundle.yaml

+
At this stage, the `trident-operator-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx` pod is deleted.

. [OPTIONAL] If the install parameters need to be modified, update the `TridentProvisioner` spec.
+
----
$  kubectl patch tprov <trident-provisioner-name> -n <trident-namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"debug":true}}'
----
. Install the cluster-scoped operator.
+
NOTE: Installing the cluster-scoped operator initiates the migration of `TridentProvisioner` objects to `TridentOrchestrator` objects, deletes `TridentProvisioner` objects and the `tridentprovisioner` CRD, and upgrades Trident to the version of the cluster-scoped operator being used. In the example that follows, Trident is upgraded to 21.01.1.
+
IMPORTANT: Upgrading Trident by using the cluster-scoped operator results in the migration of `tridentProvisioner` to a `tridentOrchestrator` object with the same name. This is automatically handled by the operator. The upgrade will also have Trident installed in the same namespace as before.
+

== Upgrade a Helm-based operator installation

Perform the following steps to upgrade a Helm-based operator installation.

.Steps
. Download the latest Trident release.
. Use the `helm upgrade` command. See the following example:
+
----
$ helm upgrade <name> trident-operator-21.04.0.tgz
----
+
where `trident-operator-21.04.0.tgz` reflects the version that you want to upgrade to.
. Run `helm list` to verify that the chart and app version have both been upgraded.

NOTE: To pass configuration data during the upgrade, use `--set`.

For example, to change the default value of `tridentDebug`, run the following command:
----
$ helm upgrade <name> trident-operator-21.04.0-custom.tgz --set tridentDebug=true
----

If you run `$ tridentctl logs`, you can see the debug messages.

NOTE: If you set any non-default options during the initial installation, ensure that the options are included in the upgrade command, or else, the values will be reset to their defaults.

== Upgrade from a non-operator installation

If you have a CSI Trident instance that meets the prerequisites listed above, you can upgrade to the latest release of the Trident operator.

.Steps
. Download the latest Trident release.
+
----
# Download the release required [21.01]
$ mkdir 21.04.0
$ cd 21.04.0
$ wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v21.04.0/trident-installer-21.04.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xf trident-installer-21.04.0.tar.gz
$ cd trident-installer
----

. Create the `tridentorchestrator` CRD from the manifest.
+
----
# Is your Kubernetes version < 1.16?
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_pre1.16.yaml

# If not, your Kubernetes version must be 1.16 and above
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
----

. Deploy the operator.
+
----
#Install the cluster-scoped operator in the **same namespace**
$ kubectl create -f deploy/bundle.yaml
serviceaccount/trident-operator created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
deployment.apps/trident-operator created
podsecuritypolicy.policy/tridentoperatorpods created

. Create a `TridentOrchestrator` CR for installing Trident.
+
----
#Create a tridentOrchestrator to initate a Trident install
$ cat deploy/crds/tridentorchestrator_cr.yaml
apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: TridentOrchestrator

$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/tridentorchestrator_cr.yaml

#Examine the pods in the Trident namespace
