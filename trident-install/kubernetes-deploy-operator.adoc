You can manually deploy the Trident operator to install Astra Trident. This process applies to installations where the container images required by Astra Trident are not stored in a private registry. If you do have a private image registry, use the link:kubernetes-deploy-operator-mirror.html[process for offline deployment].

== Critical information about Astra Trident 24.06
*You must read the following critical information about Astra Trident.*

// Start snippet: collapsible block (open on page load)
.*Critical information about Astra Trident*
[%collapsible%open]
====
* Kubernetes 1.31 is now supported in Astra Trident. Upgrade Trident prior to upgrading Kubernetes.
* Astra Trident strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of `find_multipaths: no` in multipath.conf file. 
+
Use of non-multipathing configuration or use of `find_multipaths: yes` or `find_multipaths: smart` value in multipath.conf file will result in mount failures. Trident has recommended the use of `find_multipaths: no` since the 21.07 release.

== Manually deploy the Trident operator and install Trident
Review link:../trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[the installation overview] to ensure you've met installation prerequisites and selected the correct installation option for your environment.

.Before you begin 

Before you begin installation, log in to the Linux host and verify it is managing a working, link:requirements.html[supported Kubernetes cluster^] and that you have the necessary privileges.

NOTE: With OpenShift, use `oc` instead of `kubectl` in all of the examples that follow, and log in as *system:admin* first by running `oc login -u system:admin` or `oc login -u kube-admin`.

[%collapsible%open]
====
. Verify your Kubernetes version:
+
----
kubectl version
----

. Verify cluster administrator privileges:
+
----
kubectl auth can-i '*' '*' --all-namespaces
----

. Verify you can launch a pod that uses an image from Docker Hub and reach your storage system over the pod network:
+
----
kubectl run -i --tty ping --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm -- \
  ping <management IP>
----

=== Step 1: Download the Trident installer package 

The Astra Trident installer package contains everything you need to deploy the Trident operator and install Astra Trident. Download and extract the latest version of the Trident installer from link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/latest[the _Assets_ section on GitHub^].  

----
wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v24.06.0/trident-installer-24.06.0.tar.gz
tar -xf trident-installer-24.06.0.tar.gz
cd trident-installer
----

=== Step 2: Create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD
Create the `TridentOrchestrator` Custom Resource Definition (CRD). You will create a `TridentOrchestrator` Custom Resources later. Use the appropriate CRD YAML version in `deploy/crds` to create the `TridentOrchestrator` CRD. 

----
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/trident.netapp.io_tridentorchestrators_crd_post1.16.yaml
----

=== Step 3: Deploy the Trident operator
The Astra Trident installer provides a bundle file that can be used to install the operator and create associated objects. The bundle file is an easy way to deploy the operator and install Astra Trident using a default configuration. 

* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.24, use `bundle_pre_1_25.yaml`.

* For clusters running Kubernetes 1.25 or later, use `bundle_post_1_25.yaml`.

.Before you begin
* By default, the Trident installer deploys the operator in the `trident` namespace. If the `trident` namespace does not exist, create it using: 
+
----
kubectl apply -f deploy/namespace.yaml
----
* To deploy the operator in a namespace other than the `trident` namespace, update `serviceaccount.yaml`, `clusterrolebinding.yaml` and `operator.yaml` and generate your bundle file using the `kustomization.yaml`. 
. Create the `kustomization.yaml` using the following command where _<bundle.yaml>_ is `bundle_pre_1_25.yaml` or `bundle_post_1_25.yaml` based on your Kubernetes version. 
+
----
cp deploy/kustomization_<bundle.yaml> deploy/kustomization.yaml
----
. Compile the bundle using using the following command where _<bundle.yaml>_ is `bundle_pre_1_25.yaml` or `bundle_post_1_25.yaml` based on your Kubernetes version. 
+
----
kubectl kustomize deploy/ > deploy/<bundle.yaml>
----


.Steps

. Create the resources and deploy the operator:
+
----
kubectl create -f deploy/<bundle.yaml>
----
. Verify the operator, deployment, and replicasets were created. 
+
----
kubectl get all -n <operator-namespace>
----

IMPORTANT: There should only be *one instance* of the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. Do not create multiple deployments of the Trident operator.

=== Step 4: Create the `TridentOrchestrator` and install Trident

You can now create the `TridentOrchestrator` and install Astra Trident. Optionally, you can link:kubernetes-customize-deploy.html[customize your Trident installation] using the attributes in the `TridentOrchestrator` spec.

----
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/tridentorchestrator_cr.yaml

== Verify the installation

There are several ways to verify your installation. 

=== Using `TridentOrchestrator` status
The status of `TridentOrchestrator` indicates if the installation was successful and displays the version of Trident installed. During the installation, the status of `TridentOrchestrator` changes from `Installing` to `Installed`. If you observe the `Failed` status and the operator is unable to recover by itself, link:../troubleshooting.html[check the logs].

[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
|Status |Description
|Installing |The operator is installing Astra Trident using this `TridentOrchestrator` CR.

|Installed |Astra Trident has successfully installed.

|Uninstalling |The operator is uninstalling Astra Trident, because
`spec.uninstall=true`.

|Uninstalled |Astra Trident is uninstalled.

|Failed |The operator could not install, patch, update or uninstall
Astra Trident; the operator will automatically try to recover from this state. If this state persists you will require troubleshooting.

|Updating |The operator is updating an existing installation.

|Error |The `TridentOrchestrator` is not used. Another one already
exists.
|===

=== Using pod creation status

You can confirm if the Astra Trident installation completed by reviewing the status of the created pods:

----
kubectl get pods -n trident

NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trident-controller-7d466bf5c7-v4cpw        6/6     Running   0           1m
trident-node-linux-mr6zc                   2/2     Running   0           1m
trident-node-linux-xrp7w                   2/2     Running   0           1m
trident-node-linux-zh2jt                   2/2     Running   0           1m
trident-operator-766f7b8658-ldzsv          1/1     Running   0           3m
----

=== Using `tridentctl`

You can use `tridentctl` to check the version of Astra Trident installed.

----
./tridentctl -n trident version

+----------------+----------------+
