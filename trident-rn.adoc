Release Notes provide information about new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in the latest version of Astra Trident.

WARNING: The `tridentctl` binary for Linux that is provided in the installer zip file is the tested and supported version. Be aware that the `macos` binary provided in the `/extras` part of the zip file is not tested or supported.

== What's new in 24.06

* Added ability for iSCSI self-healing to initiate SCSI scans by exact LUN ID if deprecated igroups are in use (link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/883[Issue #883]).
* Added support for volume clone and resize operations to be allowed even when the backend is in suspended mode.
* Added ability for user-configured log settings for the Trident controller to be propagated to Astra Trident node pods.
* Added support in Astra Trident to use REST by default instead of ZAPI for ONTAP versions 9.15.1 and later.
* Added support for custom volume names and metadata on the ONTAP storage backends for new persistent volumes.

=== Fixes

* Fixed Trident Operator to use IPv6 localhost for installation when specified in spec.

** Added support for ReadWriteOncePod PVC access mode.
** Added support for force detach for ONTAP-SAN-* volumes during Non-Graceful Node Shutdown scenarios.
** All ONTAP-SAN-* volumes will now use per-node igroups. LUNs will only be mapped to igroups while actively published to those nodes to improve our security posture. Existing volumes will be opportunistically switched to the new igroup scheme when Trident determines it is safe to do so without impacting active workloads (link:https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/758[Issue #758]).
** Improved Trident security by cleaning up unused Trident-managed igroups from ONTAP-SAN-* backends.

*You must read the following critical information before upgrading to Astra Trident 22.10.*

[WARNING]
.*Critical information about Astra Trident 22.10*
====
* Kubernetes 1.25 is now supported in Trident. You must upgrade Astra Trident to 22.10 prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.25.
* Astra Trident now strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of `find_multipaths: no` in multipath.conf file. 
+
Use of non-multipathing configuration or use of `find_multipaths: yes` or `find_multipaths: smart` value in multipath.conf file will result in mount failures. Trident has recommended the use of `find_multipaths: no` since the 21.07 release.

WARNING: The v21.10.0 release has an issue that can put the Trident controller into a CrashLoopBackOff state when a node is removed and then added back to the Kubernetes cluster. This issue is fixed in v21.10.1 (GitHub issue 669).

=== Fixes

* Fixed issue where Astra Trident logged a fatal error on shutdown (GitHub issue 597).
* Kubernetes-related fixes:
** Return a volume's used space as the minimum restoreSize when creating snapshots with `ontap-nas` and `ontap-nas-flexgroup` drivers (GitHub issue 645).
** Fixed issue where `Failed to expand filesystem` error was logged after volume resize (GitHub issue 560).

** Fixed the case where an `ontap-san-economy` FlexVol might be full of snapshot LUNs (GitHub issue 533).
** Fixed custom YAML installer issue with different image (GitHub issue 613).
** Fixed snapshot size calculation (GitHub issue 611).
** Fixed issue where all Astra Trident installers could identify plain Kubernetes as OpenShift (GitHub issue 639).

=== Experimental enhancements

* Added support for volume replication in the `ontap-san` driver.
* Added *tech preview* REST support for the `ontap-nas-flexgroup`, `ontap-san`, and `ontap-nas-economy` drivers.

== Known issues

Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using the product successfully.

* When upgrading a Kubernetes cluster from 1.24 to 1.25 or later that has Astra Trident installed, you must update values.yaml to set `excludePodSecurityPolicy` to `true` or add `--set excludePodSecurityPolicy=true` to the `helm upgrade` command before you can upgrade the cluster.
* Astra Trident now enforces a blank `fsType` (`fsType=""`) for volumes that do not have the `fsType` specified in their StorageClass. When working with Kubernetes 1.17 or later, Trident supports providing a blank `fsType` for NFS volumes. For iSCSI volumes, you are required to set the `fsType` on your StorageClass when enforcing an `fsGroup` using a Security Context.

* When using a backend across multiple Astra Trident instances, each backend configuration file should have a different `storagePrefix` value for ONTAP backends or use a different `TenantName` for SolidFire backends. Astra Trident cannot detect volumes that other instances of Astra Trident have created. Attempting to create an existing volume on either ONTAP or SolidFire backends succeeds, because Astra Trident treats volume creation as an idempotent operation. If `storagePrefix` or `TenantName` do not differ, there might be name collisions for volumes created on the same backend.

* When installing Astra Trident (using `tridentctl` or the Trident Operator) and using `tridentctl` to manage Astra Trident, you should ensure the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set. This is necessary to indicate the Kubernetes cluster that `tridentctl` should work against. When working with multiple Kubernetes environments, you should ensure that the `KUBECONFIG` file is sourced accurately.

* To perform online space reclamation for iSCSI PVs, the underlying OS on the worker node might require mount options to be passed to the volume. This is true for RHEL/RedHat CoreOS instances, which require the `discard` https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/discarding-unused-blocks_managing-file-systems[mount option^]; ensure that the discard mountOption is included in your https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[`StorageClass`^] to support online block discard.

* If you have more than one instance of Astra Trident per Kubernetes cluster, Astra Trident cannot communicate with other instances and cannot discover other volumes that they have created, which leads to unexpected and incorrect behavior if more than one instance runs within a cluster. There should be only one instance of Astra Trident per Kubernetes cluster.

* If Astra Trident-based `StorageClass` objects are deleted from Kubernetes while Astra Trident is offline, Astra Trident does not remove the corresponding storage classes from its database when it comes back online. You should delete these storage classes using `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* If a user deletes a PV provisioned by Astra Trident before deleting the corresponding PVC, Astra Trident does not automatically delete the backing volume. You should remove the volume via `tridentctl` or the REST API.

* ONTAP cannot concurrently provision more than one FlexGroup at a time unless the set of aggregates are unique to each provisioning request.

* When using Astra Trident over IPv6, you should specify `managementLIF` and `dataLIF` in the backend definition within square brackets. For example, ``[fd20:8b1e:b258:2000:f816:3eff:feec:0]``. 
+
NOTE: You cannot specify `dataLIF` on an ONTAP SAN backend. Astra Trident discovers all available iSCSI LIFs and uses them to establish the multipath session. 

* If using the `solidfire-san` driver with OpenShift 4.5, ensure that the underlying worker nodes use MD5 as the CHAP authentication algorithm. Secure FIPS-compliant CHAP algorithms SHA1, SHA-256, and SHA3-256 are available with Element 12.7.
